  <p class="cnt"><img src="images/lapaz/bolivia_icon.gif" width="38" height="25" /><strong>Bolivia, Oruro: 26th October 2002</strong></p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October26th/02_oct26_02.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" />The owner from a beautiful farm                                   called Hacianda Cayara outside Potosi (the farm                                   we were told is 500 years old and is truly spectacular!)                                   made sure that we were well-fed and Miss M did                                   the same for herself whilst she was in Potosi,                                   eating lots of healthy vegetarian food and drinking                                   freshly squeezed juices and shakes whenever she                                   got the opportunity. We were rather worried about                                   her before we arrived in Potosi but she promised                                   us that she will make sure to put on those much                                   needed pounds before we head off again. So after                                   our four-day stay and a good rest the three of                                   us were ready to face new challenges and to continue                                   with our journey.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Our                 first day passed without much hassle and after about 32km we arrived                 in a small town called Llacalle. Miss M found a corral for us but                 we were later <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October26th/02_oct26_03.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />moved to make place for the four donkeys who were                 supposed to stay there for the night. Miss M went round from house                 to house later that evening with one of the local guys to try and                 get us some Sebada (popular with cows) but it was all in vain as                 no-one was prepared to sell any to herâ€¦ So we had to be satisfied                 with a bag of maize and avena that had arrived with one of the Flotas                 (long distance busses) which Miss M had arranged from Potosi to                 be delivered to a few villages on our way. Miss M found herself                 a big meeting room to sleep in and fortunately there was a spare                 matress she could use for the nights rest.</p>
  <p class="cnt">The                 following morning Miss M was told that our next village would be                 about <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October26th/02_oct26_04.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />35km on but after 8 hours ride we were still in the middle                 of the mountains at an altitude of about 3800 metres with not a                 village or town in sight. Camping somewhere would have been impossible                 as well as there were no trees to which Miss M could tie us up.                 We were very lucky when we spotted later that afternoon a little                 settlement down in a valley which consisted of about 3 houses and                 corrals where they kept their Llamas. Miss                 M approached one of the men with a funny colourful traditional cap                 on his head and he agreed to let her have one of the corrals a bit                 away from the settlement. She bought a bundle of <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October26th/02_oct26_05.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />Sebada from him                 and as the rain started to come down combined with a strong wind,                 she began to pitch her tent a few metres away from our corral. After                 about an hour's struggle with the pitching, an out-of-breath (strenuous                 activity not easy at these high altitudes!) Miss M finally settled                 inside the tent with all the riding equipment and saddle-bags nestled                 at her feet. Just before dark she went to ask for hot water for                 her thermo and had to be satisfied with black tea and a few <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October26th/02_oct26_06.jpg" align="right" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" />crackers                 for dinner. The night was a long and cold one (for all of us!) and                 when the sun threw its friendly face over the mountains early the                 following morning we slowly started to get ready with stiff and                 cold bones for another day's ride.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Our                 third day's ride after Potosi was a nightmare and Miss M had learned                 a precious lesson which is never to ask a local person the distance                 to the next destination - especially not in kilometres. More helpful                 would be to know how long it will take walking and then one can                 make the calculation as to what this would be ridingâ€¦..Miss                 M had no breakfast that morning but she didn't worry too much as                 she was told that our <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October26th/02_oct26_06a.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />next village would be about 5 kilometres onâ€¦                 this didn't turn out to be the case however and after a very frustrating                 38km ride through mountains and valleys with hardly a person in                 sight we arrived at Cruce Ventilla late that afternoon.</p>
  <p class="cnt">At                 our next village, Tola Palca, Miss M met three cyclists who were                 cycling from Canada all the way down to Buenos Airesâ€¦. one                 of them even planned to go further and attempt a round-the-world                 trip with only two wheels as company. They invited Miss M to stay                 with them in <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October26th/02_oct26_07.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />a Casa de Salud, a two-roomed building which is used                 as a medical                 centre for the villagers who are in need of treatment or vaccinations.                 We were put up in a corral and Miss M paid a few local eager young                 girls to cut some dry grass for us. It was another freezing night                 with dust-storms first and later fierce winds and even snow. Mise                 and I lied down in the corral (Miss M cleared away all the stones                 for us earlier) but we both agreed the next morning that it had                 been the worst night for the two of us so far.</p>
  <p class="cnt">The only thing that kept us going at this stage was that La Paz was ahead and we knew that we would be able to get                 a good rest and proper food once we reach this capital city of Bolivia,                 3-days ride from the Peruvian border.</p>
