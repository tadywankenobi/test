  <p class="cnt"><strong><img src="images/lapaz/bolivia_icon.gif" width="38" height="25" />Bolivia, Tarija : 17th September 2002</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="cnt">We all had butterflies crossing                                   into a new country but there was a feeling of                                   great excitement as well between the three of                                   us. Miss M knew that once we cross that border                                   we will be on our own completely so it was a combination                                   of mixed feelings when we said goodbye to Eduardo                                   LaRey from the Argentine Gendarmeria and started                                   our next stretch downhill into Bolivia.</p>
  <p> <span class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October25th/25oct_01.jpg" width="300" height="150" align="left" />This was the first day                 of our journey that we didn't know where we will sleep that night                 and in a way it added to the atmosphere of adventure… a kind                 of braving the unknown.</span></p>
  <p class="cnt">The scenery was beautiful and for most of the day                 we were riding with the mountains on either side of us, passing                 little houses where curious men, woman and children looked at us                 in astonishment. They were all very friendly though and we got a                 lot of enthusiastic waves and questions. It was an overcast day                 and ideal for traveling and even though we had to go on the tar-road                 for most of the time (no place on the side of the road) we were                 not overly exhausted when we arrived at a small settlement later                 that afternoon. It consisted of a house and &quot;lapa&quot; in                 front, which the people living there turned into a little dining                 place for passersby. It was the ideal place to stop as there was                 a lot of green grass in the front for us to munch on and the young                 lad helped Miss M to get settled and to pitch her tent (the first                 time since we started!). We weren't tied up and Miss M was so sure                 that we wouldn't go anywhere but she didn't notice the sugar cane                 fields behind the house and it was not long before we made our way                 over there… well actually Tusa initiated this…. So the                 next moment when she looked up from her plate of food we were gone!                 It was great excitement for all the kids though and they all came                 running through the fields trying to find us. Tusa gave our location                 away in the form of leaving a little &quot;message&quot; (I think                 you catch my drift!) as we were heading deeper into the fields and                 it was not long before we were brought back to our original spot                 again.</p>
  <p class="cnt">The next few days were uphill and downhill a lot but                 it was so scenic around us that we didn't mind it too much. Miss                 M got off every time there was a long and steep downhill and walked                 with us. We appreciated the gesture and we imagine it is good for                 her as well, giving the legs a bit of a stretch. </p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October25th/25oct_02.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="250" />Our                 second stop was at a tiny village, which consisted only of about                 4 houses, a church and a school. Fortunately there was a river nearby                 where Miss M could wash the off the sweat from our backs, let us                 have some drinking water and get to rinse herself. We arrived at                 LaMamora on the third night and were taken to the house of the local                 priest who turned out to be Australian. Miss M was delighted to                 get the opportunity to speak English again and also to be able to                 sleep in a house and not the tent. We were quite high up in the                 mountains and it can get really chilly after the sun had set. There                 wasn't any grass or alfalfa for us to eat here so Miss M bought                 a big bag of maize that had to see us through. It gave us some energy                 but we left the following morning still hungry and we couldn't wait                 to get to a patch of grass again. We didn't do too big a distance                 that day as Miss M knew we hadn't had much to eat and by midday                 we stopped at a very cosy and picturesque village called La Merced.                 A very small community lives here and everybody contributes to the                 general maintenance of the village, school and <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October25th/25oct_03.jpg" align="right" height="250" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="150" />church. Mateo who                 lives there with his wife and three kids seems to be &quot;running                 the show&quot; and he offered Miss M a room in his house. The lads                 cut some sugar cane leafs for us and we also were fed small bits                 of maize. We caused a bit of a stir though when I followed Tusa                 to investigate the main road (he got a cut on his fore-leg in the                 process and we were covered in black thorns marching through some                 bushes) and Miss M wasn't impressed at all when she finally caught                 up with us. She spent the next hour trying to get the thorns off                 (the machete great for this although we were both holding our breaths…)                 and afterwards we were the proud owners of very lush coats again.                 Augustine is another man who lives in La Merced and he helped Miss                 M to give our shoes a &quot;service&quot; (she planned on getting                 us new ones in Tarija) and he also secured the straps that she use                 to tie up the pack. We nearly had a nasty accident the previous                 day when part of the strap broke and Tusa went wild. Everything                 went lopsided under his belly and he kicked and jumped as if his                 life depended on it. Poor thing…must have given him an awful                 fright. I got a bit of a scare as well because I didn't realize                 straight-up what had been happening and the next moment I just felt                 the leading rope tighten and saw from the corner of my eye, Tusa                 charging past us, kicking and bolting. He calmed down eventually                 and Miss M got off me to rescue him and the pack (well most of the                 pack was strewn all over the road at this stage). Fortunately Miss                 M could work out a plan for tying up our things until our next stop                 and apart from a torn saddle-bag and a gash on Tusa's back leg (wasn't                 his day), we all survived the incident. </p>
  <p class="cnt">At                 one stage, going through the mountains we encountered an awful lot                 of trucks and men working on the roads. Some of the machines that                 they were using were awfully big and made a lot of noise and Miss                 M was really proud of how we handled this and that we didn't get                 very scared. We all got annoyed at the dust in our faces though                 and as Miss M chose to close her eyes for a few seconds every time                 a big truck passed us, I thought it sensible not to do the same….you                 couldn't help but notice how far the river was below us and a miss-step                 could easily have seen us all plunging down to eternity!</p>
  <p class="cnt">The road to Padcaya was absolutely amazing and we                 had to stop a few times to take in all the beauty that surrounded                 us. The vegetation was quite dry in this part but the different                 shades of brown had an appeal of its own as it covered the valleys                 and mountains for as far as we could see. We spotted a few people                 living in these mountains in little mud-houses, leading very simplistic                 lives with no luxuries, far away from the trappings that modern                 life can bring….</p>
  <p class="cnt">We all tried to get an early night in Padcaya as Miss                 M planned to do the next day in one go - 50km to Tarija - a town                 where we had a &quot;contact&quot; and where we had decided to stay                 for a few days of rest.</p>
  <p class="cnt">The gods were looking down on us the following day,                 because it had rained during the night, turning the day into a cool                 overcast one, which makes a long distance ride a lot easier (well,                 to be truthful…the legs still get very tired but there is probably                 less sweat and exhaustion). It even started to rain again about                 7km into our days journey but by the time Miss M had managed to                 get her rain poncho on, it had stopped again!</p>
  <p class="cnt">The tiredness sat heavily in our bones by the time                 we reached Tarija. Miss M stopped at a little shop with a house                 at the back on the side of the road to ask for water and the people                 laughed at Tusa and I fighting over the bucket. Just before we entered                 the city, we were met by our &quot;contact&quot; - a very friendly                 man called Jorge Blacud (we know his family, the Trigo's in BA,                 Argentina) and we followed him to where he had arranged for Tusa                 and I to be kept for the duration of our stay. We arrived at the                 army base and was met by Colonel Lopez who arranged for a young                 lad to take Miss M and us cross country through the army camp and                 pass a river to Club Hipico, which was going to be our home for                 the duration of our stay in Tarija.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October25th/25oct_04.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="300" />As                 I am dictating this diary update, we are still in Tarija as Miss                 M had decided to stay a few days longer to give us the opportunity                 to gain a bit more body-weight before we head on again (fingers                 crossed she doesn't decide that she needs to do the same for herself…!).                 A vet came out two days after our arrival to give us a check-up                 and we got the all clear. In fact he was surprised that we were                 in such good shape after having done so many miles. He also confirmed                 Miss M's suspicions that I was indeed in &quot;that time of the                 month&quot; again, so Miss M now understands slightly better why                 Tusa recently got the odd side-kick (no biting!) from me and why                 I run like a mad-woman down to the other horses when she lets us                 out of the paddock in the mornings!! </p>
  <p class="cnt">Our next stretch is going to be difficult and challenging                 and apart from having to go up to really high altitudes and the                 problems one can encounter with these heights, we will also have                 to cope with bone-chilling colds at night on the Altiplano. We hope                 to reach Potosi (the world´s highest city at 3876m above sea                 level) in about two weeks.</p>
