  <p><span class="cnt"><strong><img src="images/portovelho/brazil_icon.gif" width="38" height="25" />Brazil, Porto Velho :                                   2nd February 2003</strong> </span>  </p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="images/portovelho/01.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />The                                   New Year saw us arriving in Guayaramerin, the                                   Bolivian border town with Brazil. Mise and I were                                   invited to stay at a lovely place called Itauba                                   Lake Lodge with acres and acres of grass as well                                   as an inviting lagoon to tip our toes into, should                                   the heat become too much.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Miss M was glad for a bit of rest                                   period (apart from having to recover from the                                   tough ride through Beni) especially as she was                                   slightly worried about the ´affectionate´(trust                                   a female – Mise! – to come up with                                   such an excuse for a <img src="images/portovelho/02.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="right" />word to act as a smoke-screen                                   for pure nastiness) little bites I had on my side                                   which was taking ages to heal.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Fortunately                 Miss M had enough sense to know that saddle blanket and girth friction                 on these sores can be a painful experience and she thought it wise                 to call in the local Vet to check me out. I stood still and was                 as good as gold whilst I got my antibiotic injection and others                 although the same couldn’t be said about Mise. She was tripling                 around like she had sat on an ants nest as the Vet came closer for                 her vitamin injection and Miss M suggested that the little drama                 queen gets her front feet tied up to stop her from dancing <img src="images/portovelho/03.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />around                 all over the place. Well, when the long needle finally pierced into                 the soft skin of Mise’s neck (even I started to feel sympathy                 for her when I saw the trembling lower lip), she had not only her                 feet tied up, but also a rope around her whole body with 2 lads                 holding tightly. We were all relieved when the little ordeal came                 to an end. </p>
  <p align="justify" class="cnt">So,                 while were enjoying the lush green grass and tranquility of our                 new environment, Miss M made a few journeys to the Brazilian side                 (on a 10 minutes<img src="images/portovelho/04.jpg" width="300" height="150" align="right" /> boat ride as Brazil and Bolivia are divided by                 a big river) to organise our entry into the next country. She met                 the Veterinary Surgeon, Luis Fernando Diehl from the Ministerio                 de Agricultura on the Brazilian side and from what she had been                 telling us, he was only help and friendliness                 all the way. Miss M also had to talk <img src="images/portovelho/05.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />to the people at Customs, the                 Federal Police and the Department of Sanitation and she was amazed                 at the open and warm attitudes of these people. Unlike the authorities                 in Peru, the Brazilian crowd did everything they could to make our                 entry into Brazil a smooth and easy experience and we were all surprised                 at how painless it all was.<br />
      <br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify" class="cnt">But,                 not everything with TATA is moonlight and roses and I am ashamed                 at what I have to share with you next....and anyway, if I don’t                 tell you, Mise would<img src="images/portovelho/06.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="right" /> jump at the opportunity to revel in some gossip.                 So I made the decision to come out with it straight and honest (like                 any decent man would off course), thus avoiding Mise´s version,                 which without a doubt would have consisted of long relays with irrelevant                 information, emotional hysteria and who knows what else!</p>
  <p align="justify" class="cnt">So in a nutshell...<br />
      <br />
      We                 finally got everything ready to leave for Brazil and arrived at                 the port (about 7km from where we were staying), drenched to the                 bone in pouring rain. There was a big barge that we had to get on                 to, sharing the space with two very large <img src="images/portovelho/07.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="left" />trucks and I couldn’t                 believe my eyes when I saw Mise, who usually would have had the                 shivers at this stage, acting in true unpredictable female spirit,                 simply walking on with Miss M up the ramp. I wasn’t so sure                 though and my (very strongly developed!) male intuition kept me                 on my toes and even Miss M’s tongue clicking and soothing                 sounds and pulling on my head collar, couldn’t stop me from                 being glued in my tracks.<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify" class="cnt">To                 cut a long story short, the next very unfortunate incident unfolded....<br />
    Miss M pulled in the front and a strange man got behind me and without                 much ceremony (or warning) gave me a burning sensation on the bum                 with some<img src="images/portovelho/08.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" /> object. I wasn’t impressed, so I kicked, hitting                 his knuckles into a bloody mess. Miss M had to suppress a giggle                 because this is the first time she had seen me kick! Next moment,                 SHE goes partly behind me, letting another man pull on the rope                 in the front. I was in foul mood at this stage and when I saw from                 the corner of my eye Miss M´s arm raising, I reacted and what                 was intended as a “warning” ended up as a full force                 blow on Miss M’s right arm elbow. I crinched, hoping and praying                 that she would be alright. She wasn’t. </p>
  <p align="justify" class="cnt"><img src="images/portovelho/09.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />Within                 minutes her arm had swelled with all the different shades of blue,                 purple and red and when we arrived on the other side, her veterinary                 friend insisted taking her to the local hospital. Service was poor                 (Luis believes the best hospital in Guayra Mirim is an aeroplane!)                 and after some waiting, the two of them left to purchase a proper                 sling and handful of painkillers themselves. It was quite clear                 that riding was out of the question for at least a week to ten days                 and on the Vet’s advice and with his help, they arranged for                 a truck to transport us all to Porto Velho, about 280 km north into                 Brazil.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="cnt"><img src="images/portovelho/10.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="right" />Here                 Miss M had to organise a boat that had to take the three of us to                 Manaus as there are no roads in service and everybody has to go                 via the river. Miss M met two friendly lads (Frank from Holland                 and Brian from the USA) who work in Porto Velho and surrounding                 area in Telecommunications and as they both speak the ´lingo´,                 they ended up being a great help and really good company for the                 five days we had to hang around until Miss M finally got the green                 light for departure of our Cargo Boat.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="cnt"><img src="images/portovelho/11.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />Mise                 is whining in my ear about wanting to tell all about our boat trip                 on the river, arriving in Manaus, blood tests, waiting and waiting                 and more. As usual, she will get her way...</p>
