  <p><strong><img src="images/manaus/brazil_icon.gif" width="38" height="25" hspace="40" vspace="40" align="middle" /></strong><strong> Brazil, Manaus : 12th March 2003</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/manaus/01.jpg" width="150" height="200" hspace="40" vspace="40" align="left" />A                                   lot of water had gone into the sea since our last                                   correspondence and I feel that I have to break                                   some very sad news to your first….</p>
  <p>My big pal Tusa, companion, friend                                   and kindred spirit for 9 months was diagnosed                                   with the dreadful virus, Equine Infectious Anaemia                                   (EIA) and had to put down a week ago. It is still                                   hard for Miss M and I to talk about what had happened                                   but for the sake of our travels and everything                                   that is involved, we know that we have to continue                                   and keep on looking forward. Tusa wouldn´t                                   have wanted it any other way.</p>
  <p>So although still with                 sad hearts at Tusa´s departure from this world, we continue                 to stay positive and committed to what the three of us had started                 9<img src="images/manaus/02.jpg" width="150" height="209" align="right" /> months ago. And Tusa might be buried here in Manaus but in spirit                 he will be with us… all the way. A big thanks to each and                 everybody for their wonderful mails about Tusa and for encouraging                 and supporting Miss M and I.</p>
  <p>Tusa                 finished our last update, telling that we had found a boat in Porto                 Velho that will take us all the way to Manaus, deep in the heart                 of the Amazon. We had no choice about this means of transport as                 everybody travels by boat, whether they like it or not! Miss M realized                 very quickly that it was a blessing in disguise that we went on                 a Cargo boat instead of the traditional passenger ones, as this                 meant hardly any other                 <img src="images/manaus/03.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />travelers accompanying us, which was great! Excluding Tusa and I,                 there was a four strong crew (the captain, his assistant, the maintenance                 man and his wife, the cook), a Brazilian Missionary and his son                 and, of course, Miss M.</p>
  <p>Tusa                 and I had a little spot on a huge barge where we shared the space                 with hundreds of bean bags and packets of spaghetti, 3 cars and                 Miss M´s pitched tent. The barge was pushed by a small boat                 and during the day, Miss M sat on the little deck in her chair (especially                 <img src="images/manaus/04.jpg" width="150" height="200" align="right" />acquired for this trip), reading, trying to improve her Spanish                 (although everybody else around us spoke Portuguese!) and playing                 her Irish flute (still badly I am afraid to say!). </p>
  <p>Apart                 from keeping a watchful eye over us, she also fed us regularly with                 food and water, scooping the latter from the river with a bucket                 and long rope. She also cleaned our living space round the clock,                 which made us (and everybody else on board) very happy! In Porto                 Velho she managed to secure twelve bags full of saw dust, so at                 least <img src="images/manaus/05.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />Tusa and I had a comfortable stand and at night we usually                 lay down on our comfy bed. Our                 food consisted of a mixture of nutrients that come in a bag and                 whenever the boat veered to the side, everybody enthusiastically                 helped to grab and pull juicy, green reeds for us to munch on. It                 was overcast most of the time but one day it got very hot and Miss                 M suggested that they use some of the plastic to make a roof for                 us. A strong wind was blowing<img src="images/manaus/06.jpg" width="300" height="150" align="right" /> and Tusa and I got quite scared with                 all this plastic flapping very noisily over our heads and I think                 Miss M feared at one stage that we were going to jump into the river!                 Once the plastic roof was secured, it was quite cosy underneath and                 it made a huge difference not to have had the piercing sun, <img src="images/manaus/07.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />burning                 onto our skin.</p>
  <p>I got a bit restless by the 5th day and was quite                 relieved when I saw the lights of Manaus in the distance, a day                 later. I had a little accident coming off the barge, slipping on                 the metal surface with my shod feet, falling flat on my side. Miss                 M then had the brainwave (because I really struggled to get up)                 to put plastic bags around my hoofs, so I finally managed to get                 up on my four feet again after some time.<br />
      <img src="images/08.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="right" /><br />
       Miss M had a contact here in Manaus, a girl called Tammy, and she                 and her partner Johnny, were such a great help to us all. Tammy                 arranged that we were transported from the port in style by a fancy                 truck from the Military Police to her and Johnny´s farm. It                 is also here where Tusa is resting now. Miss M planned on a 3-day                 stay in Manaus but it turned out to be much longer as we had to                 be tested for Mormo (a very serious disease for horses <img src="images/manaus/09.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="left" />here in the                 Amazonas) and EIA, which poor Tusa diagnosed positive for. The blood                 tests for Mormo had to be sent to Sao Paulo (which is almost on                 the other side of the world!) and when Tusa´s results came                 back as inconclusive, the procedure had to be repeated again.</p>
  <p>But,                 our luck had to turn and we finally leave tomorrow, heading towards                 the Venezuelan border. Our new companion is called Tu Fein (it means                 ´yourself´in the Irish language). Thanks Mr Coman for                 coming up with such an appropriate name!! He (Tu Fein and not Mr                 Coman!), is half Criollo, half Quarter Horse, with a good energetic                 walk. I´ve met my match here because everytime we´ve                 been together so far, he has tried to nip me but I am sure our relationship                 will smooth out as time goes on.<img src="images/manaus/10.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" /></p>
  <p>I                 will give Tu Fein a chance for a few words with our next diary entry,                 which will be from somewhere in Venezuela.</p>
  <p>Until then my friends!</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As usual I forget to mention the most important stuff                 till last! Miss M was very impressed with the services of DHL who                 recently got a parcel from Dublin to Manaus in 3 days!! She mentions                 to us (and everybody else who is prepared to listen!) regularly                 about this fantastic sponsor and their speedy and professional service.                 We also want to thank HorseHeaven again for continuing to support                 the TATA challenge, sending us much needed goodies on a regular                 basis. Their spray against flies and other biting insects, an absolute                 winner!! The quality of <img src="images/manaus/11.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="left" />their products are much admired throughout                 Latin America!<br />
    <br />
      Last                 but not least, we´d also like to mention our latest sponsor,                 Maximuscle, who provides Miss M with protein drinks (Miss M couldn´t                 stop talking about the chocolate flavour until she tried Strawberry                 recently!!!) and energy bars, making sure that she can never ever                 complain again for being hungry or tired!</p>
