				<p>&quot;I am delighted and feel priveleged to be involved in Marianne's trip across the americas. She is an amazing person with focus and passion for this, that I know will get her through the tough days.</p>
				<p>It is a mammoth task both in organising and completing and Marianne has shown that she has all the necessary ingredients.</p>
				<p>I both envy and admire Marianne and I would love to be going myself - I hope to join her for part of her trip in September. May she be safe and blessed throughout the wonderful adventure.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It was not hard to catch the glint of determination in Marianne's eye and I assessed that it was probably a sign of sure success in her quest.</p>
  <p>I am happy to give her my support for this venture and I can understand her drive and determination to do such a journey. I attempted it myself for the very same reasons.</p>
  <p>Clearly the charity she is supporting by doing it, is a great cause, which brings a lot of joy to many people.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;To contemplate undertaking a project of such magnitude is a tribute to Marianne's vision and single-mindedness not to mention her generosity and courage.</p>
  <p>It is the sort of life altering project that will put her in a very special category of people who have not been limited by the usual boundaries that we confront in our lives. I have absolutely no doubt but that her dream will be fulfilled and I wish her every success.</p>
  <p>I am delighted to be associated with the TATA Challenge as a Patron will be very happy to support her in whatever way we can.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It was a pleasure to meet Marianne and she cannot begin to comprehend what's round the corner for her. I wish her the very best luck, courage and success with a journey that will inspire her and others she touches.</p>
  <p>At a lecture after my trip through South America, somebody asked, 'So what did your learn?' I could not answer. The question was too great. I would urge all those that are considering backing Marianne to commit now.&quot;</p>

    <p>&quot;When  I first met Marianne I was struck by her vision and determination.  There are many people who have dreams or adventures but very few who  see them through into actuality. Marianne has that rare drive,  commitment and passion, which is required to see a project of this  scale succeed.<br />
    </p>
    <p>The Aisling Project is committed to the TATA Challenge and is proud to be  associated with it.Â On this adventure, a wonderful example of human  spirit, I offer Marianne my continued support and hope others will do  the same.&quot;</p>
