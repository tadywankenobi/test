  <p>So, we were three                                   again and just when we thought we could get going                                   again, Miss M got the flu… and just when                                   she got over it, the weather changed and it was                                   rain, cold and wind for 5 days solid. Everybody                                   advised us NOT to leave while the weather stayed                                   miserable and we were all very happy after a few                                   days to have seen bright sun and blue skies again.                                   Miss M was sad to leave all her new friends behind                                   and she promised Santiago Castellanos that while                                   she is in Argentina, she would only drink Villa                                   Mora wine. Miss M was very impressed with this                                   lovely red wine and was lucky enough to have some                                   every night during her stay in Cordoba. Santiago                                   also said that Villa Mora would become one of                                   the official sponsors of the TATA Challenge in                                   the form of providing help and contacts along                                   the way… and he had indeed stayed true to                                   his word. For those who would like to read more                                   about this tasty wine, the origin of the name                                   Lola Mora and much more, go to <a href="http://www.lolamorawine.com.ar/" target="_blank">www.lolamorawine.com.ar</a>.</p>
  <p> It was a Saturday morning                 when everybody gathered very early at El Galpon, grooming us, drinking                 Mate and getting the packs ready. Miss M decided that I would be                 the riding horse and Tusa would be on the lead. Eduardo (the lad                 who has the polo school at El Galpon) and his girlfriend and her                 sister all got on top of their horses to accompany us out of the                 city as they knew all the short cuts and back-roads. When we got                 outside Cordoba city on the main road to our next destination, we                 said goodbye to our riding companions and headed off.</p>
  <p>Tusa wasn't co-operating greatly and kept on pulling                 back for the first 10km but got a bit better after that… well,                 until we had our first little accident. I don't know what happened                 exactly but all of a sudden Tusa gave a big jump and in the process                 the leading rope went around Miss M's leg, pulling her off me, straight                 to mother earth! I got an awful fright and nearly stepped on Miss                 M as she hit the ground. Fortunately nobody was seriously hurt and                 after Miss M regained her composure, she looked around to see who                 had spotted the fall! She led us to the nearest tree to catch our                 breath and after a while she was back on top of me again.</p>
  <p>Everything went smoothly until Tusa and I spotted                 our first train and what happened next was truly terrifying. I am                 forbidden to tell you what happened - Miss M's orders - but all                 I can say that it was nearly a fatal incident. Apologies for having                 to keep you in suspense but I am sure that Miss M will share the                 story with you at some stage.</p>
  <p>Because of all the happenings during the day, we arrived                 at the outskirts of Jesus Maria when it was already dark. Miss M                 was very tired and hungry and had the shakes when we finally came                 to a halt. Our host-family arrived and the two girls offered to                 ride us back to the house and Miss M to go in the car. Miss M was                 so happy about this and when we finally arrived at the house, she                 already had a shower and was ready to tuck into the barbecue.</p>
  <p>The                 next morning Mr. Sebastian Bush looked at our feet and announced                 that  whoever shod us, had done a bad job and suggested to rectify                 the matter. He is a very experienced Farrier and in no time we were                 the proud owners of new shoes. Our next stop was only 25km away                 on a dirt road and when we got their Carlos awaited us with lovely                 alfalfa, maize and water. He was also so kind to hose down our tired                 and warm legs. He breeds Criollo's himself and he gave Miss M a                 lot of sound advice while she tucked into Sylvi's peach tart. </p>
  <p>The following day was an early start for we had another                 long stretch ahead of us. The last 10km must have been the most                 difficult as Miss M developed terrible pains in her knees and feet.                 She took her legs out of the stirrups every now and then to give                 them a stretch and we were all ecstatic when we saw the outlines                 of Dean Funes in the distance. We had a very warm welcome by the                 Bechara family, the kids even gave Miss M roses to say Bienvenido                 (welcome!) and we were also met by the local TV station for a quick                 interview.</p>
  <p>Everybody was very concerned about us going through                 the Salinas (salt lakes) between Dean Funes and Frias and after                 much consideration Miss M agreed that we would all be transported                 to our next destination. She was told that riding through the Salinas                 might be too hard on us as it is very isolated with little food                 and only salt water to drink. Miss M had planned to camp out with                 us but was told that it would have been freezing cold in the evenings                 with not even a tree in sight for shelter. Juan Carlos Bechara used                 his contacts in Dean Funes to get a horsebox and after a bit of                 drama to get us in, we were off to Frias. Here we were met by a                 very hospitable family who were half Arabic and Miss M told us afterwards                 of all the exotic food she had been fed. She mentioned a dish which                 consists of raw minced meat and Miss M said the only way managed                 to swallowed this was after it was &quot;heavily coated&quot; with                 olive oil and black pepper. </p>
  <p><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/others/signpost01.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="40" width="200" />The                 trip between Frias and Tucuman was very long and very boring. The                 road just stretched out in front of us with not a curve in sight.                 At times there was hardly any riding space next to the road and                 we had to go onto the tarmac - not the most comfortable for our                 legs and feet. At one stage Miss M went into the long grass next                 to the road and when we got onto the road again, we were all covered                 in the most annoying little thorn possible…. the girths, the                 poncho, Miss M's trousers, her sweater, our coats….. everywhere                 was this white beastly thorn which breaks off in little pieces when                 you try to get it off and Miss M ended up spending the whole evening                 to getting it out of everything.</p>
  <p>Simoca was our last stop before Tucuman and here Miss                 M got much more than what she bargained for in the form of a terrible                 electric shock from a lampshade in the room that she was sleeping                 in. Her host felt very responsible for what had happened and got                 the local doctor out to give Miss M an injection. Miss M slept until                 lunchtime (great timing!) and needless to say, we didn't go anywhere                 that day. The next day our host offered to accompany Miss M to Tucuman                 (a 52 km ride) on horseback but after 15km his horse's shoe came                 loose and he was forced to turn back. We were all exhausted when                 we arrived in Tucuman and after some calculations, I realized that                 we had done about 230km in five days. Pancho Crito (our host) met                 us just outside the city and within 15 minutes we had to look pretty                 for the newspaper people. We were also welcomed by a Gaucho on his                 white Peruvian horse and after that Miss M left us at his brother's                 house where we would rest for the next few days. </p>
