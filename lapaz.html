  <p class="cnt"><img src="images/lapaz/bolivia_icon.gif" width="38" height="25" /><strong>Bolivia, La Paz : 10th November 2002</strong></p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="images/lapaz/01.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />The city of Oruro turned out not to be as bad                                   as we had anticipated if you could look past the                                   horrible outskirts and dirt as you enter the place.                                   Miss M had previously arranged for us to stay                                   at the Club Hipico (an Army base) and the only                                   snag was that we were not allowed out of our stable                                   as there were a few Stallions around who had been                                   giving me (Mise) &quot;the eye&quot; and I imagine                                   I need no further explanation apart to say that                                   &quot;contact&quot; could have proved to be disastrous                                   for our journeyâ€¦..(Sorry, I can't expand                                   more but this is a site for little children as                                   well and I am sure you can read between the lines!).<img src="images/lapaz/02.jpg" width="150" height="200" align="left" /></p>
  <p class="cnt">Leaving                 Oruro after three days we had to go through the length of the city                 and it took us nearly 2 hours before we were on the open road again.                 Tusa was not an easy companion that day and he kept on pulling back,                 making it very difficult for me to keep my rhythm and to continue                 in my usual energetic way. Progress was slow, the sun was hot and                 I could sense that Miss M got quite frustrated with Tusa who kept                 on acting like an untamed donkey all the way until we arrived in                 the town of Caracolla 45km later. We received a lot of stares and                 curious questions and it took quite a while before Miss M had us                 and herself settled for the night. <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/November10th/02_nov10_03.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />She                 was given a big blue matress to put on the floor of the local municipality                 with a chilling wind roaming through the big space but fortunately                 a few blankets followed a while later. We were locked up in an area                 with two old trucks and patches of green grass to graze on. The                 man who owns this wanted to <span class="cnt">tie us up first for fear that we might                 savage his apple tree but Miss M who doesn't like to see us tied,                 assured him that we certainly have no special taste for the leaves                 from trees.</span></p>
  <p class="cnt">Our                 ride to the next village was interesting with lots of school-kids                 on the way in <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/November10th/02_nov10_04.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />bright red uniforms who waited on the side of the                 road when they saw us approacing from a distance. Some had very                 intelligent questions to ask whilst others kept on giggling with                 their hands shyly covering their mouths! They all loved our names                 and thought it very funny when Miss M told them the meaning, which                 is &quot;me&quot; and &quot;you&quot; in Irish.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Miss                 M later had a bit of a confrontation with a man who wanted money                 when he saw us chewing on some Alfalfa on the side of the road but                 I will let Miss M tell you all the juicy details of what happened,                 later.</p>
  <p class="cnt">We                 stayed at the local school in Panduro and we truly received such                 a warm <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/November10th/02_nov10_05.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />welcome from especially the teachers who couldn't do enough                 for us. The kids brought us down to a little stream to quench our                 thirst and Miss M went off to find us some food to see us through                 the night. She was later invited for a basketball-game with the                 teachers and some kids but was out of breath so quickly (just as                 well she could blame the high altitude for her fatigue!) that a                 replacement had to be found after about 15 minutes.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Lahuachaca                 was 30km on the following day and before we could find out spot                 for the night at another Casa de Salud we had to go through hundreds                 of trucks and little stalls and people rushing aboutâ€¦ it turned                 out to be the weekly market <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/November10th/02_nov10_06.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />and after all the comments, whistles                 (the culprits got a few dirty looks from Miss M) and stares we were                 delighted when we finally came to a rest even though there were                 very little food around. Miss M walked up later to the market to                 buy a few goodies for the evening but had no luck in finding anything                 else for us. So we were over the moon the next day when after about                 seven kilometres, we saw acres of Alfalfa on the side of the road                 and we hardly noticed the rain that turned into hail as we were                 eagerly stuffing our mouths with this delicious green plant!</p>
  <p class="cnt">The journey from Lahuachaca to Patacamaya was a pleasant                 overcast one even<img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/November10th/02_nov10_07.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" /> though Miss M had to struggle with Tusa who was                 the riding horse for the day. In fact he was in such a lazy and                 laidback mood that she decided halfway to ride me again and put                 the pack on Tusa. I was okay with this was it not for my one back-shoe                 that had become loose but fortunately Miss M noticed this and put                 a few extra nails in before we set off again.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/November10th/02_nov10_08.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />Tusa                 and I couldn't wait to arrive at the Los Sargentos Club and Miss                 M was truly delighted to have received an invitation from them,                 offering to give Tusa and I a home for the period that we will be                 in La Paz. We initially felt a bit intimidated by all the beautiful                 and stylish show-jumping horses at the club but after breaking through                 the language barrier (some of them tried to be awfully posh), it                 became clear that deep down we all shared the same <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/November10th/02_nov10_09.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />insecurities                 and fearsâ€¦ although Tusa and I do believe that our tails are                 far more superior than any of those we had seen here so far. It                 was generally agreed by everyone that we are indeed very special                 horses to be undertaking this often arduous journey and when we                 lightly asked who of them would have the courage to do the same,                 our question was met by much neighing and shaking of heads.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Miss M is using the time before her friend Miss Tracy                 arrives, to organise and <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/November10th/02_nov10_10.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />streamline her equipment and also to start                 sorting out all the papers she needs before we can cross the border                 into Peru. </p>
  <p class="cnt">We                 are so happy to be kept in this wonderful place with a warm stable                 every night and Alfalfa twice a day and I imagine it will be quite                 hard to get going again having to face new hardships and rough riding                 day to day. We both know however that we will continue to have very                 ineresting experiences as we go along, seeing<img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/November10th/02_nov10_11.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" /> pretty places and                 meeting people from different cultures.</p>
  <p class="cnt">A                 big thank you to all those generous people who helped us to have                 such a wonderful journey through Bolivia. You will be in our hearts                 forever!!!</p>
