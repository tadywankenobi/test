		<p>With Kieran her husband, they made a marvelous firm together where Jo was the Managing Director and Kieran the Chief Operations Officer.  Kieran thought he was the boss and she allowed him to delude himself.  "Dream on Kieran", she would say with a Napoleon-like wave of her hand.  She told me how much she loved Kieran and daughters Laura and Sara, even when as she would put it, Kieran needed a bomb put under him, Laura needed a spell in a "Stop Smoking" clinic and Sarah was acting like a reverend mother!! She was immensely fond and proud of Emma, her little grand-daughter.</p>

			<p>Jo was a very important and influential member of the IBEC team. She was extremely talented.  Her qualities included the ability to handle almost any problem with sensitivity, her total devotion to the members of IBEC and their needs, extraordinary organisational skills and that most rare of qualities, excellent judgement.</p>
			
			<p>But she was much more than the sum of all of these.  She was first and foremost a wonderful human being.  The overwhelming outpouring of affection, love and respect for her by colleagues makes it very clear that she touched everyone that came in contact with her.  There are scores of friends and colleagues here this morning who will testify that her universal popularity was due to the selfless way she gave everybody of her time and comforting ear, always in an unconditional and non-judgmental way.  Everyone elseâ€™s problem was more important than any consideration of her.</p>
			
			<p>The qualities most often attributed to her were her gentleness, her serenity, her selflessness, her total disregard for her own problems, her great zest for life and her sense of fun.  After she had been recently hospitalised she said to me, "what a bloody nuisance I've turned out to be." When she told me last December that the cancer had returned, she apologised for giving me bad new before Christmas!  She won her place in all our hearts simply because she always gave unconditional and non-judgmental love and support.</p>
			
			<p>We are all challenged now to reconcile our grief with the celebration of her relatively short but wonderful life.  We would all have wished to have her around for many more years, especially for Kieran, Laura, Sarah and Emma.  That is not to be.  Her illness, borne with grace and dignity, may have battered her poor body into submission, but it has not beaten her spirit.  That lives on and is her gift to us.  We will always treasure it.  That spirit will nourish and sustain Kieran and the girls in the weeks and years ahead.</p>
