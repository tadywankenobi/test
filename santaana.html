  <p><span class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/07August/02.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="134" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></span></p>
  <p align="left" class="cnt"> <span class="cnt">The Endurance Riders in San Salvador who had invited                                   Miss M for dinner had also offered their help                                   to get us to the Guatemalan border in the best                                   way and suggested that they ride with Miss M for                                   a day or two through farms and small little roads.</span></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="cnt">We                 were all delighted with this arrangement because we were starting                 to get a bit weary of all the tarmac riding and trucks and buses                 brushing past us far closer than what we would consider as comfortable                 (and safe). So on the morning of our departure out of San Salvador,                 Miss M said her goodbyes to the Palomo family and went with Felipe                 and Carlos to the stables. On arrival, Miss M was pleased to see                 that the lads were already grooming and getting us ready for our                 days journey. A few pictures were taken and around 9:30am we were                 on our way. Taken the distance we were to do that day (about 47km)                 into account, Miss M, Mise and I were quite concerned about time                 and were we on our own, we would have done already 15km by this                 time! But we kept quiet and decided just to go with the flow for                 the day.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/07August/04.jpg" height="134" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" /> <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/07August/05.jpg" height="136" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" /> \ </p>
  <p class="cnt">After                 the first farm gate we went through, we encountered a mean looking                 stallion who had his eye on Mise straight away. He had a very long                 mane and an “I mean business” look in his eye and Miss                 M rushed past him with some speed – I first thought he was                 after me (these days you can never be sure) but yer man headed straight                 for the other stallion in our group. They came head to head in a                 very aggressive way and made these awful combat-like noises, snorting                 and scraping their forefeet on the ground….and then nothing!                 All bark and no bite is what Mise said afterwards with a disenchanted                 grunt. <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/07August/09.jpg" align="right" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" /></p>
  <p class="cnt">The whole group (there were about 5 other riders)                 had to come to a halt a number of times in the beginning as the                 pack just didn’t sit right on Mise and Miss M had to fix it                 every time. There is only one little (secret) spot that makes the                 pack stay put and sometimes easier said than done to find this sometimes                 elusive “zone”. The great thing though was that we were                 off the beaten track and it made all the difference. In                 some parts the road surface was quite rocky and the route up-and-downhill                 but we had nothing to complain about with nice company, the sun                 shining gently down on us and a pleasant breeze. We also rode past                 the weekend-retreat of the current El Salvadorian President and                 the lads indicated that he would have joined us was he there at                 the current time. Probably with a bodyguard or two in tow I thought                 by myself… imagine that!!</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/07August/12.jpg" align="right" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="132" />Miss                 M, Mise and I were very pleased to see that both Felipe and Carlos                 made a point of walking (on the ground) with their horses at times,                 especially when going downhill. It is also a good opportunity for                 the riders to give their legs some exercise. We really wish more                 people would get into this habit as it gives us horses a good break                 and it’s less strenuous on the limbs and joints. We have witnessed                 some serious brutality during our journey where people would stay                 on their horses while going over rocks on very steep down-hills.                 They just don’t realize the damage…and in our opinion                 – neither do they seem to really care.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/07August/13.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="136" />Lunch                 was around 2pm on a farming village and we were dismayed at all                 the rubbish and dirt lying on the ground. The farm was seized many                 years ago by the government and it was very apparent not the better                 for it.<br />
    Around 4 pm we came out of the mountains and onto the main tarmac                 road. <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/07August/14.jpg" align="right" height="134" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />We                 had still a bit of a distance to do though and it seemed unlikely                 that we would make it before darkness fell. A short while later,                 our fate for the day was decided though when a television station                 from San Salvador arrived to do some footage of Mise, Miss M and                 I. The Endurance lads were told to wait in the front for us and                 for the next hour we had to say “whiskey” more times                 than we could have cared for while the cameraman struggled with                 the remaining light. </p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/07August/18.jpg" align="right" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="134" />It                 was almost dark when the filming finished and our companions who                 were patiently waiting, informed us that a trailer will take all                 of us for the remaining few kilometers to our destination in Santa                 Ana. It was relief all around as the clouds had already begin to                 gather and just after we got loaded, the rain started to pour down.                 Our host for the night was the hospitable Dr Reina. A                 real gentleman. He ordered Pizza’s and beer for the party                 and also gave up his bed for the night so that Miss M could have                 a comfortable rest.</p>
  <p class="cnt">So on this snoozy note I will sign off folks. <br />
    Mise will have the opportunity to report from Guatemala next. Ciao!!</p>
