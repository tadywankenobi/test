	<strong>Crying with Cockroaches</strong> tells the story  of an undertaking against the odds: a journey considered by many to  be madness. Yet, South African born Marianne Du Toit was determined  to follow her dream - adamant that with only two horses for company,  she should explore the Americas, travelling from Argentina to New  York City over 21 months, finishing in March 2004.
  <p align="justify"> Limited equestrian experience, hardly any  contacts and an unknown continent, she persevered. Despite it being a  journey of heartbreak, frustration, bureaucracy, loneliness, danger,  and hunger, nothing stopped her from following her heart.</p>
  <p align="justify"> But this is not only a story of struggle and  pain. It is also one of great joy and personal rewards. From peasants  to high society, Marianne experienced the true human spirit of  generosity. Her adventures had a powerful message - you can overcome  the impossible if you are determined and positive. Humour and a  &quot;taking everyday as it comes&quot; attitude helped a great deal  too.</p>
  <p align="justify"> Her story, told with simplicity and warmth, is  bound to capture the readers' imagination. It is a story to be  enjoyed by the young or old, fellow adventurers or those who simply  prefer to explore the world from the comforts of their armchairs.</p>
  <p align="justify"> <img src="images/abc-person.jpg" width="138" height="140" class="right" />During the US stretch of her journey, Marianne  featured as <strong>ABC Person of the Week</strong> with Peter Jennings and  also appeared with one of her horses in a programme for the History  Channel, called &quot;<strong>The Master: Emilio Solanet</strong>&quot;.  </p>
