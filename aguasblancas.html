  <p class="cnt">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="cnt">I had been asked                                   so many times WHY I had bitten Tusa and my answer                                   is the same as ever… &quot;it was an accident&quot;.                                   I prefer not to dwell on this matter (I can write                                   books on men and their ability - or rather lack                                   of - to handle pain) so before we get into a battle                                   of the sexes, I'd rather share some more details                                   of <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/others/marianne12.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="300" />our adventure with you….</p>
  <p class="cnt">We                                   officially left Los Lapachos on the 27th August,                                   2002 and it was with a heavy heart that Tusa,                                   Miss M and I said goodbye to the Leach family. </p>
  <p class="cnt">Miss M was also given                 some very good maps by Sheila (a very informed woman who knows a                 lot about many things and who is originally from Zimbabwe but had                 to leave years ago because of a terrorist attack on their farm)                 of Bolivia and we were all relieved that at least our chances to                 get completely lost had been slightly diminished. Sheila also took                 pictures of Tusa´s sore back (oh how he loved the attention!)                 and one of the pictures shows how Caroline Leach treated the wound                 with an Aloe Vera leaf taped onto his back. He looked seriously                 comical to say the least!</p>
  <p class="cnt">Chito the gaucho on the Leach's farm escorted us to                 the main road and from there on it was just the three of us again.                 Miss M rode me and Tusa was on the leading rope, lazily trotting                 along behind me. The saddle-bags had been sent on with the Gendarmeria                 and it put Tusa in great sprits that he could travel lightly to                 our next destination. </p>
  <p class="cnt">Our first stop was with the Gendarmeria in San Pedro                 and from their we went to Fraille Pintado and although it was only                 28km it took as a full day to get there. It was a terribly hot day                 (we were later told that it was 40 degrees Celcius in the shade!)                 and by 12 O´clock Miss M realized that we have to stop. There                 were not many trees to find cover under but Miss M spotted a little                 settlement in the distance and we went to investigate if there was                 any life at all. A very friendly and helpful man called Louis invited                 Miss M in while Tusa and I were given water by one of his workers.                 Well, it was so hot with a strong warm wind blowing dust in our                 faces that we only left around four that afternoon. Miss M got fed                 a tasty pasta dish and lots of home-made limonade (water, fresh                 lemon and sugar). Just outside San Pedro and again before you enter                 Fraille Pintado, we encountered two groups of picaterras, people                 who rebel against the poor economic situation in Argentina and who                 hold up and disrupt the traffic, but we had no problems with them                 at all and no-one tried to stop us. We got a few whistles from a                 couple of boys and just trotted through as if a 150 people obstructing                 the road was the most usual thing to see! Rio Zora was our next                 stop and when we arrived lunchtime hot and sweaty, Miss M with a                 few of the Gendarmeria men took us to the river for a nice wash.                 We were still bugged a lot by the midges and mosquitoes and Miss                 M´s ankle was very badly swollen from all the bites. We told                 her not to scratch but she didn't pay much attention to our warnings                 and the infected part took on all the colors of the rainbow for                 a few days. I just have to add as well that Miss M is the worst                 patient ever and I know Miss Caroline Casey will be able to vow                 for this. We heard via the grapevine about a certain incident just                 before Miss M left Ireland that basically involved the two of them                 having too many glasses (or shall I tell the truth and say bottles?)                 of champagne, dancing around to Cyndi Lauper and before they realized                 what happened, Miss M on the floor with a sprained ligament! </p>
  <p class="cnt">But enough gossip. Back to our travels…..</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/others/marianne20.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="15" vspace="15" width="150" />Yuto                 was about 130km from Los Lapachos and we started to get a bit tired                 from the everyday traveling and the only thing that kept us going                 was Miss M´s promise that we will take a short break once                 we get to Oran. The Perez family received us in Colonia Santa Rosa                 and everybody was very curious and intrigued about our travels across                 the america´s. The gaucho on the farm named Juan offered to                 accompany Miss M to Oran as he claimed to have knowledge of a short                 road. I am afraid &quot;claim&quot; is the appropriate word as our                 supposedly 15km to the Gendarmeria turned into a nightmare ride                 for more than seven hours. We went through a jungle for almost two                 hours with branches and trees hitting our faces and scratching our                 bodies while the gaucho like a real crocodile dundee cut his way                 open in front of us with a machete. After that it was hours along                 sugar cane fields and when it got dark and we couldn't spot any                 life or lights anywhere, we realized we were lost. Communication                 between Miss M and the gaucho was non-existent at this stage and                 the sulking gaucho started to trail behind further and further.                 At this stage Miss M was walking, leading Mise and Mise was leading                 me and we walked in the pitch dark on a dirt road for about 6 kilometers                 until we reached a police control and help finally arrived.</p>
  <p class="cnt">We had a great time with the Gendarmeria in Oran and                 Tusa and I got to roam the grounds as much as we liked. Miss M stayed                 in a room with her own bathroom and she couldn't stop talking about                 how friendly and helpful everybody had been. Jorge Lugo, a 1st Liteunant,                 spoke very good English and for the few days that we spent there                 he assisted Miss M with everything. He also organized for two lads                 who have farrier skills to give us new back-shoes, got the knives                 and machete sharpened, arranged so that she can use a computer,                 got the local doctor to give her an injection when she had an allergic                 reaction from the insect bites and acted as translator for two radio                 interviews. From Oran it was off to another Gendarmeria base and                 finally we arrived at Aquas Blancas, the Argentine border town.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October25th/25oct_00.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="15" width="300" />That                 evening was very hectic as Miss M with the help of Eduardo LaRey                 tried to organize our smooth entry into Bolivia for the next day                 and it was quite late before Miss M had all the appropriate papers,                 signatures and stamps. She changed her Peso's into Boliviano's and                 had dreams that night about what lies ahead of us going into a new                 country all by ourselves.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Our departure the next morning didn't happen without                 its problems and 30 meters towards the Bolivian border, the pack                 on Tusa went completely lopsided (one of the men who did the tying                 obviously didn't know his elbow from his ass -apologies but I couldn't                 express this better) and with all the kicking and jumping one of                 the saddle-bags got damaged. We went back to base and Miss M went                 with some lads to Oran to get the bags fixed and also to find a                 better solution for tying up the pack. She arrived back later that                 evening, satisfied that everything is under control and set her                 alarm for a very early start.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Our next update will be from Bolivia so watch this                 space!!!</p>
  <p class="cnt">Before I forget…. Miss M reminded me to mention                 the websites of her friend and patron Caroline Casey who had been                 supporting the TATA Challenge from the very beginning. Miss Casey                 had a wonderful adventure last year when she went across India on                 an elephant, Go to <a href="http://www.theaislingfoundation.org/" target="_blank">www.theaislingfoundation.org</a> and if you want news about her latest adventure, just click on <a href="http://www.aroundtheworldineightyways.com" target="_blank">www.aroundtheworldineightyways.com</a></p>
  <p class="cnt">And off course this also the ideal opportunity to                 mention two of our big sponsors... The one is <a href="http://www.dhl.ie/" target="_blank">DHL</a>,                 the multi-national courier company who makes sure that all our films                 and important belongings arrive safely in Ireland and also that                 we can receive certain things we need over here in a jiffy. Recently                 a magazine in South Africa called Rooi Rose needed pictures of our                 travels for an article that will appear in October and again DHL                 was there with excellent service, ensuring safe arrival of these.                 The other company who supports TATA, is <a href="http://www.dell.ie/" target="_blank">DELL                 Computers</a> and they were so kind to give Miss M a wonderful,                 state of the art, lightweight and compact laptop, the Latitude C400.                 This laptop is ideal for traveling and great to do our daily diaries                 and off course all the updates for our website as well. A big thanks                 to DELL and DHL!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
