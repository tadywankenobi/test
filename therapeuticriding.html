    <br />
So why use a horse when you can use a piece of equipment?&nbsp; It's all in the  movement:&nbsp; up and down, side-to-side and forward to back...all at the same  time.&nbsp; Throw in changes in speed, variables in rhythm and a  whole&nbsp;host of sensory inputs&nbsp;and you've got motion that impacts your  brain and body in significant ways.&nbsp;<br />
Did you know that by simply sitting astride a  moving horse, a person's sense of coordination and stability could improve? By  experiencing the constant repetition of the horse's stride, and by absorbing  this rhythm into our hips, a person's back and trunk muscles kick into action.  This stimulates nerve patterns that have lain dormant, and allows tight  ligaments to relax and become more supple.<br />
<br />
Therapeutic riding is an umbrella term covering  several distinct methods of equine therapy including therapeutic sport riding,  hippotherapy and vaulting.<br />
Equine Therapy offers benefit to  a wide range of physical issues. For example, individuals who have spasticity  (an involuntary muscle reaction), riding a horse in a therapeutic situation has  been shown to reduce the affliction. Many individuals along the Autistic  Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience significant improvements in sensory  integration as a result of the dynamic movement.<br />
Equine Therapy and its benefits  have been recognized for many years. It is a proven method of addressing the  physical, mental, emotional and developmental capabilities of individuals with  disabilities, functional limitation or medical issues. There is a healing interaction  between horses, riders and the people who help them.<br />
Riding encourages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Correct Muscle Tone</li>
    <li>Cognitive Activity</li>
    <li>Sensory Integration</li>
    <li>Gross &amp; Fine Motor Skills</li>
    <li>Increased Physical Stamina</li>
    <li>Proper Posture</li>
    <li>Independence &amp; Social Skills</li>
    <li>Emotional Stability</li>
    <li>Self Esteem</li>
    <li>Vocalization</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Smiling </li>
  </ul>
  <p>People with a disability are part of society  and must not be viewed as a marginalised group. All over the world, the success  of riding schools for the disabled is mainly because horses give unconditional  love to anyone. Unlike society, they do not care how you look and what you can  do; if you show trust in them, they will trust you too.</p>
  <p>There are more than 300 therapeutic riding  centres in the USA.  Since 2004 I have become acquainted with four centres, each of which operates  to the highest standards and are totally committed to what they do.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.ctrcinc.org/" target="_blank" class="pagetext">ctrcinc.org</a><br />
  The Colorado Therapeutic Riding Center  (CTRC) is a NARHA Premier Therapeutic Riding  Center in Longmont, Colorado  devoted, since 1980, to serving children and adults with disabilities. As the  oldest and largest therapeutic riding center in Colorado, and one of the largest in the  nation, CTRC serves over 700 riders through their dynamic programs and has an  impressive work force of over 1,000 volunteers each year. At CTRC, not only are  the participants bodies nurtured but their minds and spirits as well. For over  a quarter of a century, those involved with CTRC has witnessed the profound,  life enhancing benefits of equine assisted therapeutic services.<u> </u></p>
  <p><a href="http://equicenterny.org/" target="_blank" class="pagetext">equicenterny.org</a><br />
  EquiCenter Inc  began its programming in Mendon, New York in May of 2004, offering a number of therapeutic riding, hippotherapy, vaulting  and horsemanship (equine  facilitated mental health) sessions. Its goal is to provide a safe,  appropriate, productive and enjoyable environment where participants can work  toward their individual goals.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.thorncroft.org/hcsis.htm" target="_blank" class="pagetext">thorncroft.org</a><br />
    The  mission of Thorncroft is to help build the physical, emotional and mental well  being of all people; particularly those with special needs, through  establishing an atmosphere of cooperation, respect and love in an equestrian  environment. They are committed to a mainstreaming approach of teaching  horseback riding, and to promoting the development of new and independent  therapeutic riding programs.</p>
  <p><a href="http://highhopestr.org/" target="_blank" class="pagetext">highhopestr.org</a><br />
    The mission of High Hopes is to improve the lives of  people with cognitive, physical, and emotional disabilities through the  benefits of therapeutic horseback riding and other equine-assisted activities,  while serving the therapeutic riding profession through training and education.  Beginning as a group of nomads with borrowed horses, High Hopes has become a  leader both in providing therapeutic riding services and in setting the  standards for service, training and education in the profession.</p>
