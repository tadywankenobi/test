		<h3>Toto</h3>
		
		<p>Time spent with Toto, the first Tennessee Walking-Horse I have ever ridden, certainly proved to be an interesting experience. </p>
		
		<p>He was not perfect by any means and had a real stubborn and bossy streak. In fact, you’d call him hardheaded despite his big dewy eyes, which could easily mislead to make you think he was a pushover. From the start he wanted to be boss and did not like to be in second place. Ever.
		</p>

		<p>There was also a softness in him however and he was the type that liked cuddles and to be close all the time. Some people interpreted this as a lack of respect for my ‘personal space’ as they would call it but I understood Toto, and to me he was just a softie that wanted physical affection whenever he could get it.  </p>
		
		<p>He was not the easiest on the road and often would behave in erratic ways, pulling Camanchi in all directions when he was on the leading rope. His jumpy behaviour caused my Argentine saddle to be ripped in two with all our belongings scattered over snow-covered ground, and another time it resulted in Camanchi getting a gash above his right eye. Still though, I enjoyed Toto’s spirit and I felt very protective of him. </p>

		<p>He got to spend some time with Mise when they were together in New Jersey, and also on our last day’s ride through Central Park. Noises were made by the mounted patrol unit about wanting to buy Toto and even though I had no doubt that he would be very well looked after, I envisaged a life of open spaces and fields to roam for him. I also wanted his owner to be female. Toto was a sensitive soul and I believed he needed a soft and understanding touch. I knew he would not cope in a pressurised city environment. </p>

		<p>He now lives in Virginia with a couple that simply adores him, despite some of his shortcomings. I saw Toto again towards the end of 2007 and could not have asked for a better place for him to spend the rest of his days.</p>
