  <p class="cnt"><strong><img src="images/riberalta/bolivia_icon.gif" width="38" height="25" />Bolivia, Riberalta : 12th January 2003</strong></p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="images/riberalta/01.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />I                                   know it's been a while since you all have heard                                   from us and Tusa, Miss M and I want to apologise                                   for the silence but things really have been quite                                   hectic since our last diary entry. Miss M however                                   wants me to thank everybody on her behalf who                                   continues to be in touch with us even though there                                   hasn't been much news from our neck of the woods                                   recently.</p>
  <p>Miss                 M never though that getting Tusa and I into Peru would prove to                 be so <img src="images/riberalta/02.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" />difficult and in fact almost impossible. When Miss Tracy left                 after her visit in La Paz (from what we've heard they had a lovely                 time together and we were all sad to see her go), Miss M started                 in full earnest to arrange for our entry into the next country (Peru)                 but the bureocracy and red tape were just unbelievable! And when                 they spoke of an at least 15-day quarantine period at the border                 <img src="images/riberalta/03.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />Desagaudera (with no proper facilities for us horses), Miss M realised                 that we had to look at other options. She also found out that it                 wasn't be possible to ship Tusa and I from either Peru or Ecuador                 and as she had made the decision long ago not to go through Colombia,                 it would have meant getting us on a plane from Quito in Ecuador,                 which would have been far too costly.</p>
  <p>Then                 a friend suggested that we continue through the north of Bolivia,                 through a<img src="images/riberalta/cocohomenone.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" /> part that is called Beni and cross into Brazil at Guayaramerin.                 So a decision was made. This change of plan and route involved a                 new shopping list as well and Miss M went out to get lots of insect                 repellent, sunblock, injectable Vit B1 (to keep the mossies away)                 and she also had to go for the obligatory Yellow Fever injection. </p>
  <p>Now,                 we knew the tropics are hot and humid but we never thought that                 it would<img src="images/riberalta/05.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" /> be that difficult and it's been a tough and rough ride                 since we left the city of La Paz.</p>
  <p>Before I continue with our news, the three of us just                 want to say a big big heartfelt thanks to the following people for                 their wonderful generosity and for making our stay in La Paz truly                 comfortable and unforgettable. So thank you very much Chacho Gonzalez,                 Fernando Prado. Luis Iturralde, Gabriel Vidakovich, Luis Vasques,                 Miguel Reznicek and Edwin. Also to <img src="images/riberalta/06.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />Peter O'Toole from the honoury                 Irish Consulate for his help, his friend Peter Elsner who arranged                 for us to see his farm Espiritu in Beni and last but not least to                 David Horgan, a friendly Irish lad who took back Miss M's excess                 belongings to Ireland, knowing that he will probably have to explain                 (redfaced!) the women's clothes in his bags when searched at the                 airport in Miami!</p>
  <p>But back to our news…<img src="images/riberalta/07.jpg" width="150" height="200" align="right" /></p>
  <p>We                 got into our journey with a BANG when we went with two Gaucho's                 (cowboys) through farms from San Borga to Espiritu, doing about                 120km in two days. Miss M learned a lot from these fellas and once                 she got over her tiredness, aches and pains, she was actually glad                 to have done this as it meant not having gone on the main road,                 making for a more interesting (and harder) ride. I won't start whining                 now about all the swamps and mud we had to go through with our shod                 feet, not to mention being chewed by insects on a continuous basis                 as one whining woman in our company is more than enough! </p>
  <p><img src="images/riberalta/08.jpg" width="150" height="200" align="left" />We                 also spotted our first yellow Cobra going down a narrow road through                 grasslands and it happened so quickly that we had no time to jump.                 The snake swished in front of us with great speed and agressive                 attitude, right in front of Tusa's legs into the long grass. Tusa                 told me afterwards hat he could feel the snake's tail going over                 his hoof. Yeah right! This comment from good ole' Tusa just added                 him to the long list of some men we all know who simply have to                 add on tails to look all macho and brave! I just gave him a patronizing                 look and turned my head away so that he didn't see the grin on my                 face!</p>
  <p>We                 also crossed quite a deep river and all our equipment was taken                 to the <img src="images/riberalta/09.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" />other side on a little canoe. I swam quite well if I can                 say so myself but I feared for my pal Tusa when he struggled to                 find his feet at the edge of the steep bank. It was a nice cool-down                 though, just a pity it was over so quickly.</p>
  <p>Miss M started to use her tent in full swing from                 Las Petas but then disaster struck when it got stolen the next day.                 We were left behind at a small settlement called Casa Blanca and                 Miss M had to travel all the way to Riberalta in a truck, which                 took about 7 hours, to buy a new one. <img src="images/riberalta/10.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />Transport not that great in                 this part of the world and with it being Christmas and all, it meant                 we saw her again, only 5 days later. The tent that Miss M found                 was not nearly as good as the one she had but it has to do until                 she can get a better one. A good friend in Ireland who knows that                 we have very limited funds, offered to pay for a better one and                 we are very happy at this gesture to help us out!</p>
  <p>Conditions                 from Casa Blanca to Riberalta were basic and quite primitive. <img src="images/riberalta/11.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" />Although                 we had grass to eat in most places. Miss M wasn't always so lucky.                 In some places, even after she had offered to pay for food, some                 women were simply to lazy to get out of their hammocks to prepare                 something. I must just add that these are not towns we stopped at                 but little settlements with a few houses and surely no shops or                 café's. In other places again we were pleasantly surprised                 when <img src="images/riberalta/12.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />people offered food without Miss M asking and who simply refused                 payment with big smilesWe                 entered the New Year whilst resting for a day in a small village                 called Australia where women wash their clothes on big wooden boards                 in the river (Miss M joined them enthusiastically and after a while                 found out that it is quite hard work!) and cows and horses graze                 freely going from spot to spot through the village. I                 <img src="images/riberalta/13.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" />quite fancied a young black stallion but he showed no interest in                 my special fancy walk, apart from pulling back his ears when I came                 close. So I imagined he was already spoken for. My attempts for                 attention resulted in a lot of teasing from Tusa who looks like                 a war veteran these days. All scars, scratches and little gashes                 over his body but he loves it and can't even seem to be bothered                 by my recent little affectionate bites which ended up causing more                 damage than intended.</p>
  <p><img src="images/riberalta/14.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" />Miss                 M wants to tell about how we had to go in the pitch dark on two                 different nights recently, for quite a few hours and we won't spoil                 her story by saying anything more. I just want to add that Tusa                 and I both found this rather a scary experience and would prefer                 not to do it again. Enough said.</p>
  <p>Our                 last 50km to Riberalta was probably the worst we have done so far.                 Miss M slept only 2 hours the night before and <img src="images/riberalta/15.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" />we didn't have the                 most comfortable spot ourselves for the night, so it was an exhausted                 trio that left the little settlement that morning. Fierce heat and                 a long long road ahead of us, didn't help matters much. On top of                 things, Tusa's back shoe came loose and I pulled a muscle in my                 back leg. Miss                 M got off me and walked with us for about 25 km until we could see                 the outskirts of the city in front of us and the green slopes of                 the farm where we hoped to be spending the night. I don't think                 any one of us would have been able to do another kilometre and it                 was relief all around when Miss M opened the big wooden gate and                 we wearily walked down to the house to ask permission to rest our                 tired bones.Tusa                 will tell you more in our next diary entry about our stay for a                 few days in Riberalta and about arriving in Guayaramerin, the Bolivian                 border town with Brazil. He is also very keen to tell you the story                 of our encounter with eight (!) Aligators on the way in a place                 we never expected them to be but I imagine this is a story for Miss                 M to be told another day.</p>
  <p>Until                 then amigos!</p>
