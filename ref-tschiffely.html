  <p><span class="headerfont1">Reference to Aime  Tschiffely in the book <br />
      <em>Crying with  
  Cockroaches – Argentina to New York with Two  Horses.</em></span></p>
  <p>The idea of going from East to West Coast  appealed to me but it was reading Tschiffely’s Ride that made up my mind for  me…. PAGE 14<br />
      <br />
    It turned out that my ‘paranoia’ was justified. A few weeks before I set  off to Buenos Aires, a girl in a health shop in Dublin, informed me of  her two friends who “are planning to do Tschiffely’s Ride.” My heart stopped  for a moment. She did not notice and continued…. PAGE 15</p>
  <p>Gordon wanted to emulate Tschiffely’s  ride in 1974 but after a couple of months on the road, one of his horses had an  accident and had to be put down… PAGE 16</p>
  <p>While looking for sponsorship from an equestrian shop I  stumbled across a book by Ann Hyland on the Endurance Horse. Inside was a piece  called, “Buenos Aires to New York’ – an account of Tschiffely’s ride.  Most of what I read was old news but it was the last few paragraphs that gave  me sleepless nights for a while…. PAGE 24</p>
  <p>According to Tschiffely these were the toughest horses  alive, conditioned and bred for hundreds of years by the laws of nature. Since  it reproduced mainly in the wild, the Criollo developed into an extremely hardy  horse. Hunted by Indians and wild animals they learned to survive the extreme  heat and cold, subsist with little water, and live of the dry grasses of the  area…PAGE 24</p>
  <p>These were the two world-renowned equines of  unparalleled endurance that made it possible for Tschiffely to have his  adventure across the Americas.  I had a lump in my throat when I saw them. It felt like I knew them… PAGE 46</p>
  <p>Somebody who did see the article in the <em>El Tribuno</em> was a man called Ingeniero Roberto Osvaldo Tschiffely. He sent me an  email on the 18th of August telling me that he was a direct  descendant of Aimé Tschiffely…. PAGE 105 </p>
  <p>Later in the living room, one of the guests  mentioned Tschiffely and what he had accomplished. He said, “Tiefie had a dog  throughout his journey.”  I found his  pronunciation hilarious but refrained from laughing…. PAGE 140</p>
  <p>It was rather a conservative purchase compared to  Tschiffely who not only had a .45 Smith &amp; Wesson with him but also carried  a 12-gauge repeating shotgun, a Winchester  .44 and a .45 long six-shooter. He clearly expected more trouble than I did…  PAGE 141</p>
  <p>I made the decision to organise transport across the Golf of  Fonseca to El Salvador for  three reasons: 1. Tschiffely went that way in 1925, 2. We could skip Honduras - one  set of veterinary documents less to organise and 3. It was shorter and had the  potential to be a different kind of adventure…PAGE 329 </p>
  <p>Later, we crossed a bridge over the River Lempa on the way  to San Nicholas. When Tschiffely was there in 1925 things were more basic and  he had to take a boat across… PAGE 340</p>
  <p>Peter had read <em>Tschiffely’s  Ride</em> and was absolutely fascinated by it. He kept on saying how much he was  looking forward to reading about my own experiences one day….PAGE 395<br />
    <br />
    The road to Darlington  was insanely busy. It is worth mentioning that in 1927, Tschiffely finished his  journey prematurely in Washington and not New York City as originally planned, due to ignorant  drivers and a near fatal accident on the US roads.… PAGE 397                                                                          </p>
  <p>“Like Tschiffely,” she said, “you  have real love and affection for your horses.” PAGE 400</p>
