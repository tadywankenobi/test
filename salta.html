  <p class="cnt"><strong><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/flags/argentina_icon.jpg" align="absmiddle" height="25" width="38" />Argentina, Salta : 5th August 2002</strong></p>
  <p class="cnt">Miss M and I                                   left later that morning with only a few of our                                   belongings with us. The rest had been sent on                                   with Tusa to the farm. Our next stop was Metan.                                   On the way though, we went up a steep hill and                                   somehow I twisted my leg and no matter how hard                                   I tried, I couldn't stop limping. Miss M was very                                   concerned. She tried to get a vet out but with                                   no success and as we were in the middle of two                                   towns, Miss M knew that we had to go either way                                   before it got dark. So it was all hop-along-cassidy                                   for me until we reached Metan. Because of all                                   the limping Miss M and I went really slow and                                   we also stopped a lot so when we arrived on the                                   farm of Magdalena and Marcelino Sierra and their                                   boys, it was already dark. It was a cold night                                   and later that evening Miss M and Magadalena came                                   out to put a duvet on my back. I appreciated the                                   intention but unfortunately it wasn't secured                                   very well so during the night and after a few                                   movements on my side, it fell to the ground. The                                   next day was bright and sunny though and it wasn't                                   long before I forgot about the chilly wind that                                   went right through my bones the previous night.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Miss                 M thoroughly enjoyed her stay on the farm and she and Magdalena                 had lots to chat about. Magdalena speaks perfect English so of course                 neither of them made an effort to try and get Miss M to improve                 her Castellano (Spanish)! The vet came out to look at my leg (he                 treated the wrong one though!) and Miss M also got some vitamins                 in town for me to keep me going. So the night before we had to leave,                 she played &quot;vet&quot; and injected this thick black liquid                 into my neck- on both sides. I could sense Miss M was a bit nervous                 and this made me a bit edgy as well so when I felt the first prick                 I started moving around - spurting some of the liquid onto her clothes.                 The next day I had a little lump on the side of my neck so I guess                 I'd better stand still the next time. Hopefully Miss M will also                 have a steadier hand by thenâ€¦.</p>
  <p class="cnt">We left Metan on a cold and windy day but Miss M didn't                 mind as we followed the curvy road, going up and down with scenic                 mountains all around us. Unfortunately though I started to feel                 a pain in my leg again and this time it was much worse. Miss M stopped                 every now and then to rub cream on my leg but things didn't improve.                 Going downhill especially was very difficult and at one point I                 just simply stopped. Miss M realised that we couldn't go on and                 felt very frustrated. I spotted the tears in her eyes and I wished                 so much that I wasn't such a wimp and that we could continue. Miss                 M made a phone call to Mike Leach who lives in Mendoza and his advice                 was to stop and to get Mise up to the farm as well. Miss M was so                 disappointed but she also knew that it was the most sensible thing                 to do. There was a lot of hassle and drama to get a suitable horse-box                 and eventually Mike's brother, Anthony was so kind and arranged                 for one of their trucks to come and pick Miss M and I up. </p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/others/marianne06.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="150" />Miss                 M and I both fell in love with Los Lapachos straight away (the farm                 is called after a tree with the same name that has mostly bright                 pink flowers but these could also be yellow or white) and it is                 truly a spectacular farm. Well, I couldn't believe my eyes when                 I spotted my friend Tusa in the distance and he kept calling for                 me until we stood again face-to-face. I was happy to see him but                 it was also a difficult time of the month for me so he had a bit                 of a confused look on his face when I just gave him a friendly nod                 and walked off to munch on some alfalfa. Miss M in the meantime,                 was met by Caroline &amp; Richard Leach and they welcomed her into                 their house with open arms. Miss M stayed in one of the guest rooms                 attached to the farmhouse (Los Lapachos is open to tourists &amp;                 visitors who wish to have a taste of true Estancia life with wonderful                 food, wine and company) and she loved the big spacious rooms with                 the wide wooden windows, cool tiles and pretty views.</p>
