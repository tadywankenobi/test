    <br />
The  challenge of plain, jungle, desert and mountain had been calling to Swiss  schoolteacher Aimé Tschiffely for many years, and in 1925 he set off with his  two horses from Buenos Aires in Argentina to New York, a journey of more than  10,000 miles, covering eleven countries en route. His companions for the trail  were two Argentinean Criollo geldings: Mancha, a sixteen-year-old red and white  overo, and Gato, a fifteen-year-old buckskin.<br />
<br />
Tschiffely  has written an incident-packed account of equestrian, topographical, and  anthropological interests in his <em>Southern  Cross to Pole Star </em>(also called <em>Tschiffely’s  Ride</em>). In it, he relates the many dangers and hardships he, Mancha &amp;  Gato endured throughout the 10,000 miles, as well as the joys and hospitality  he received.<br />
<br />
Leaving  the civilization of a capital city, the horses carried him through a wide  variation of terrain and climate, as it could be possible to encounter. They  did it alone, with no back-up-crews tailing them with creature comforts for man  or horse; with little in the way of communications available once away from the  well-used tracks and into almost unmapped wilderness that made up much of their  route. 1926 South America saw many regions still unexplored, or relatively  unknown. Though just over seventy years ago, it was a very different age,  especially in the primitive areas of the South and Central American countries  the trio traversed and which comprised the bulk of the epic journey.<br />
<br />
The  horses used came originally from the Patagonian pampas. Of the renowned tough  Criollo breed, Tschiffely had the faith in, and the wish to prove, Criollo  supremacy in continuous work under harsh conditions. Bred almost wild, they  retained an inborn sense of self-preservation and Tschiffely learnt to respect  his horses' judgement of safety, especially after Gato saved them all from  miring in quicksand and in dry regions they gave advance warning of water  ahead.<br />
<br />
Being  before the days of modern veterinary science, old time herbal remedies proved  sovereign, and one item in Tschiffely's pharmacopoeia was garlic. Used crashed  with Indian pepper it was reputed to keep the bats away, crushed with alcohol  it was a remedy against mountain sickness; and by itself, again crushed, it was  supposed to be so noxious to snakes that they would stay away. All three were  hazards at differing stages of the journey and likely to bother men and horses.<br />
<br />
Throughout  his tale, Tschiffely pays tribute to Mancha and Gato, their courage and  sagacity; the sheer doggedness displayed in conditions more often than not  adverse. A lot was asked of two chunky pampas horses and they gave in generous  measure, proving beyond doubt all that is claimed for them by Criollo  aficionados.<br />
<br />
In 1974 Gordon Roddick completed 2,000 miles of  Tschiffely’s Ride and in 1989, James Greenwood went as far as Peru, Lima,  finishing 4,000 miles of the trip.</p>

  Cockroaches – Argentina to New York with Two  Horses.</em></span></p>
  <p>The idea of going from East to West Coast  appealed to me but it was reading Tschiffely’s Ride that made up my mind for  me…. PAGE 14<br />
      <br />
    It turned out that my ‘paranoia’ was justified. A few weeks before I set  off to Buenos Aires, a girl in a health shop in Dublin, informed me of  her two friends who “are planning to do Tschiffely’s Ride.” My heart stopped  for a moment. She did not notice and continued…. PAGE 15</p>
  <p>Gordon wanted to emulate Tschiffely’s  ride in 1974 but after a couple of months on the road, one of his horses had an  accident and had to be put down… PAGE 16</p>
  <p>While looking for sponsorship from an equestrian shop I  stumbled across a book by Ann Hyland on the Endurance Horse. Inside was a piece  called, “Buenos Aires to New York’ – an account of Tschiffely’s ride.  Most of what I read was old news but it was the last few paragraphs that gave  me sleepless nights for a while…. PAGE 24</p>
  <p>According to Tschiffely these were the toughest horses  alive, conditioned and bred for hundreds of years by the laws of nature. Since  it reproduced mainly in the wild, the Criollo developed into an extremely hardy  horse. Hunted by Indians and wild animals they learned to survive the extreme  heat and cold, subsist with little water, and live of the dry grasses of the  area…PAGE 24</p>
  <p>These were the two world-renowned equines of  unparalleled endurance that made it possible for Tschiffely to have his  adventure across the Americas.  I had a lump in my throat when I saw them. It felt like I knew them… PAGE 46</p>
  <p>Somebody who did see the article in the <em>El Tribuno</em> was a man called Ingeniero Roberto Osvaldo Tschiffely. He sent me an  email on the 18th of August telling me that he was a direct  descendant of Aimé Tschiffely…. PAGE 105 </p>
  <p>Later in the living room, one of the guests  mentioned Tschiffely and what he had accomplished. He said, “Tiefie had a dog  throughout his journey.”  I found his  pronunciation hilarious but refrained from laughing…. PAGE 140</p>
  <p>It was rather a conservative purchase compared to  Tschiffely who not only had a .45 Smith &amp; Wesson with him but also carried  a 12-gauge repeating shotgun, a Winchester  .44 and a .45 long six-shooter. He clearly expected more trouble than I did…  PAGE 141</p>
  <p>I made the decision to organise transport across the Golf of  Fonseca to El Salvador for  three reasons: 1. Tschiffely went that way in 1925, 2. We could skip Honduras - one  set of veterinary documents less to organise and 3. It was shorter and had the  potential to be a different kind of adventure…PAGE 329 </p>
  <p>Later, we crossed a bridge over the River Lempa on the way  to San Nicholas. When Tschiffely was there in 1925 things were more basic and  he had to take a boat across… PAGE 340</p>
  <p>Peter had read <em>Tschiffely’s  Ride</em> and was absolutely fascinated by it. He kept on saying how much he was  looking forward to reading about my own experiences one day….PAGE 395<br />
    <br />
    The road to Darlington  was insanely busy. It is worth mentioning that in 1927, Tschiffely finished his  journey prematurely in Washington and not New York City as originally planned, due to ignorant  drivers and a near fatal accident on the US roads.… PAGE 397                                                                          </p>
  <p>“Like Tschiffely,” she said, “you  have real love and affection for your horses.” PAGE 400</p>
