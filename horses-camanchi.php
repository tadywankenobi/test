		<h3>Camanchi</h3>
		
		<p>Todd and Maria only needed a phone call from friends who were my hosts for a few days in Georgia, to immediately take action when they heard I was in need of help. They were told that Pepsi, a young gelding that joined the TATA travels with Toto, was a nightmare, too green and inexperienced, and that they feared for my safety.</p>
		<p>It was already dark when a trailer pulled up outside. Inside was Camanchi and another Appaloosa - Todd and Maria wanted to make sure that the right horse was chosen! They were happy for me to take even both and all that mattered to them was that we completed our journey and arrived safely in New York City. I am still amazed every time I think about their generosity and kindness.</p>

		<p>I had no time to get acquainted with either horse. The following morning both were unceremoniously saddled up and after a few spins in the garden, we were on the road again. Camanchi proved to be rock-solid and I soon knew I wanted to continue with him and Toto.</p>
		
		<p>Looking like a grumpy old man, Camanchi turned out to be the perfect companion for our travels; funny, consistent and easy, he never gave me a day’s trouble. He was as good a riding horse as he was a packhorse and truly, there was nothing that could faze him.</p>

		<p>He accepted Toto, who could be a bit weird, without fuss and never did I notice him behaving in an intimidating or aggressive way towards him or any other horse. Camanchi grew attached to me quite quickly and his obedience and easy-going nature appealed to me no end. He had excellent endurance, the sweetest disposition and whatever negative things some people want to say about Appaloosa’s, Camanchi certainly did not fit the stereotype.</p>

		<p>I would have loved to buy him from his owners if I could, had I some land in Ireland where I could keep him. Camanchi was returned to Georgia, a week before TATA came to an end. I was so sad to see him go and regretted that he could not be there for our last day’s ride through Central Park in New York City.</p>
				
		<p>I saw him again in October of 2007 when I was in Camilla, Georgia, doing a book signing. Todd had the great idea of bringing him in to town and even though he looked more mature with more spots than I remembered, it was still the ‘old Camanchi’ from three years before.</p>
		<p>I hope he would have said the same of me...</p>
