  <p class="cnt">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="cnt">At last Mise                                   lets me have a word again and I will pick up where                                   she left of last...</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/others/marianne09.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="200" />Well,                                   I was at Los Lapachos for about four or five days                                   on my own until I got joined again by Mise. I                                   have to say I was very lucky about the break (from                                   her… only joking!) and when the &quot;team&quot;                                   arrived on the farm, I was very much rested and                                   chilled. My leg also was getting better and the                                   gaucho on the farm, regularly put some antibiotic                                   cream on the wound above my hoof. I stayed in                                   a corral next to the house of Anthony &amp; Gaby                                   Leach (he is the son of Richard &amp; Caroline)                                   and whenever Anthony would bring me alfalfa and                                   give me some fresh water, their three lovely little                                   girls would come to keep me company as well, feeding                                   me bits of maize. </p>
  <p class="cnt"> So, I was a little bit                 surprised when Mise arrived and all I got was a friendly nod and                 not even a head-rub or anything. She definitely kept her distance                 and I just thought &quot;typical woman… just when you think                 you have them sussed…&quot; and left her to herself.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/others/marianne16.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="150" />Miss                 M stayed for a night or two in the farm and then went into Salta                 city, about 70km south from Los Lapachos. She found the central                 part of the city very pretty where the square (every town in Argentina                 has one and they are wonderful meeting places, giving a nice atmosphere                 and character to the place) is and also discovered a B &amp; B but                 without the second &quot;B&quot; as they served no breakfast! Mrs                 Maria Toffoli runs the place and apparently she was very friendly,                 fussing over her guests like a real mother-hen (who doesn't feed                 her chickens?! Ha!). Miss M was also very happy when two days later                 she got to meet two really nice Irish girls (Orlaith &amp; Jacinta)                 who came over from Igaccu falls in Brazil to see her in Salta. They                 got on very well and even spent two days up in the mountains, following                 more or less the same route as the Tren de los Nubes (the train                 in the clouds). They also saw the Salinas (white salt lakes for                 as far as the eye can see combined with a powerful blue sky) and                 they all thought it extremely beautiful and out of the ordinary.                 They went up to heights of about 4250m and fortunately none of them                 suffered with the altitude. Miss M had coca leaves (they are used                 to make cocaine but you need huge quantities to do so) ready in                 her bag (the leaves are meant to keep hunger and thirst at bay and                 also to help against altitude sickness) but they all found the smell                 so disgusting that nobody dared try to put it in their mouths. A                 little birdie had told me that Miss M and the girls went out the                 night before and they saw numerous men with bulging cheeks chewing                 these leaves and they were positively put-off by the look and smell                 of this very strange habit. </p>
  <p class="cnt">And then a terrible thing happened…. </p>
  <p class="cnt">I got bitten! I imagine you would visualize some vicious                 animal now or maybe a big carnivorous bird or something but it saddens                 me to tell you that it was indeed my pal Mise who did the damage.                 I will never understand her motives and in fact I have by now given                 up trying to figure out why she sometimes behave in these &quot;odd&quot;                 ways, without warning or notice. Still, it doesn't take away from                 the fact that it wasn't pleasant to be munched like that and Miss                 M was really shocked when she saw this big bloody wound on my back,                 just below the cross. This latest development off course meant that                 instead of one week's rest in Salta, it had to be extended until                 a time that the wound has healed AND the hair has grown back so                 that I can have something on my back again. Miss M was annoyed &amp;                 frustrated but also realized that these things happen and the only                 thing one can do is to make the best of a bad situation.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/others/marianne15.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="20" vspace="10" width="150" />Orlaith                 &amp; Jacinta left the following day to go to Buenos Aires (Orlaith                 is an expert at the tango and Jacinta was going to learn a few of                 the steps of this melancholic and sensual dance as well) and Miss                 M was very sorry to see them go. She decided then that she will                 have to make the best use of the time and thought it a good idea                 to learn more Spanish and also to get her saddle-bags, etc. streamlined                 and sorted. During this &quot;waiting time&quot;, she was also very                 lucky to have met some important people in the Gendarmeria (the                 army who guard the border for drug trafficking between Boliva &amp;                 Argentina) and they offered to assist us once we are in a position                 to get going again. She also became friends with Maria Ines &amp;                 Manolo, a couple who run their own Law Bookshop and Miss M had a                 few very entertaining music evenings with them. They were also so                 kind to arrange for a little &quot;going away&quot; before she finally                 left Salta and Miss M was delighted that Ernesto Day (a very talented                 Folklore singer) could have been there as well. Miss M got a beautiful                 machete as a present from Guillermo (a man who knows a lot about                 horses. He also wears traditional clothing most days) and we thought                 indeed it was a very impressive type of &quot;knife&quot;, fitted                 into a lovely leather holder which you attach to the saddle for                 easy access. The only thing we doubted a little bit was Miss M's                 ability to use it efficiently but we thought we'd give her the benefit                 of the doubt….(until proved wrong!)</p>
  <p class="cnt">Mise and I will be in touch again. She usually can't                 wait for the opportunity to talk and so I guess the next update                 will be from her. Do not fear however, I'll be back again! </p>
