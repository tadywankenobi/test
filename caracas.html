  <p><strong><img src="images/Caracas/venezuela_icon.jpg" width="38" height="25" hspace="40" align="middle" /> Venezula, Caracas : 16th May 2003</strong><br />
      <br />
        <img src="images/Caracas/01.jpg" width="200" height="140" align="left" />Well, who would have imagined that I´d get the opportunity  to write a few insightful thoughts for the TATA Challenge web-page…. Life  certainly has an interesting way of turning and twisting!</p>
  <p>I will be no stranger to those who reads the TATA diary entries regularly as  Mise took the opportunity with the previous one to introduce me.</p>
  <p><img src="images/Caracas/02.jpg" width="132" height="200" align="left" />Never did I think that I will get the chance to experience what life has to  offer outside my compound, never mind outside of my country of origin, which is  Brazil. When Miss M came to our stables in Manaus, I was brought out into the  courtyard and my first impressions were that Miss M was not too keen on me. You  see I roll my eyes in a funny way when I am nervous and I am sure she must have  thought I have a bit of a crazy streak in me. She got on top of me nevertheless  and I knew if I wanted the opportunity to broaden my horizons, now was the <img src="images/Caracas/03.jpg" width="200" height="138" align="right" />time  to perform for it! I put up the most amazing walk man had ever witnessed and  Miss M couldn´t hide her surprise and joy. News spread fast in our  horse-community and that evening I overheard that I was indeed the chosen one  to accompany Miss M and Mise from Brazil onwards. I also got the terrible news  about Tusa…..<br />
    <br />
    <img src="images/Caracas/04.jpg" width="200" height="136" align="left" />This kind of long distance riding was quite alien to me at first but I  really tried my best as I didn’t want to disappoint my fellow companions. Miss  M was delighted about my energetic and smooth trot and then when she saw how  well I led on the rope that is attached to the saddle, she thought she had won  the jackpot! After a week or so I stopped trying to bully Mise <img src="images/Caracas/05.jpg" width="200" height="137" align="right" />when it became  clear that she accepts me as part of the trio and now we really are great  buddies.<br />
    <br />
    We arrived in Ciudad Bolivar tired and hot. It took us ages to get through  the city and as Miss M was given the wrong directions (sure we believe that!),  it took us a while before we reached our destination. We <img src="images/Caracas/06.jpg" width="200" height="135" align="left" />were put in the  backyard of the Eulacio family-home and had a good 3-day rest. On our way  through Venezuela everybody had asked us how we will cross Puente Angostura (it  looks like the bridge in San Francisco) outside Ciudad Bolivar as it is very  long (about 1.6km). The words “prohibited” and “dangerous” were also used. As  usual Miss M won’t let us tell the juiciest parts of our travels so everybody  will just have to wait for when she decides to share this experience with you!<br />
    <br />
    <img src="images/Caracas/07.jpg" width="200" height="137" align="right" />Mise got very tired from having to go on the tarmac so much and Miss M was  terribly frustrated that we couldn’t go on the side of the road. It is not with  pleasure that we have to share the news that some people in Venezuela simply do  not care about littering their country. From Puerto Ordaz and well until after  Ciudad Bolivar, we encountered loads and loads of rubbish on the side of the  road especially beer bottles – whole ones, broken ones…. Off course this made  it impossible for us to do our trotting there and <img src="images/Caracas/08.jpg" width="200" height="159" align="left" />Miss M had to choose between  the lesser of two evils…. hence we landed on the hard tar surface most of the  time.<br />
      <br />
      Miss M was urged by our friend Blancita to go to the farm of Yurubi and Jimmy  near Anaco where we can rest thoroughly. They were very friendly and good to us  and Miss M really enjoyed the company of Yurubi whom s<img src="images/Caracas/extra.jpg" width="200" height="142" align="right" />he thought to be hilariously  funny. Times are difficult for a lot of people in Venezuela at the moment and  both Miss M and Yurubi attended a demonstration on Workers Day where they  walked with banners and loud whistles through the streets of Anaco, protesting  against the government, the political and economical situation but more against  Chavez, the current president. <img src="images/Caracas/08a.jpg" width="200" height="138" align="left" />Miss M was so touched to see how many lives had  been negatively affected by troubles in Venezuela especially over the past  year, that she wrote and article about this. Off course we will let you know if  she managed to get it published.<br />
    <br />
    Miss M decided to go up to Puerto La Cruz (without us) to look at the  possibilities of finding a Cargo boat that will take us a<img src="images/Caracas/09.jpg" width="200" height="137" align="right" />ll to Central America  as you all know that the decision was made from the very beginning NOT to go  through Colombia. Four radio interviews werearranged on one day but neither  this, nor the newspaper articles nor the 11 O’clock news bulletin about our  travels, helped to secure our transport to Costa Rica as had been hoped. It  soon became clear that we will have to move to bigger and possibly <img src="images/Caracas/10.jpg" width="200" height="139" align="left" />greener pastures  and so we arrived in Caracas, the capital of Venezuala.<br />
    <br />
    Blancita continued to be in touch with us and it was also with her help that  the three of us had a resting place in the city until our exit from South  America was secured. A lot of phone-calls were made and everybody was on  ‘alert’ about the search for a boat but all in vain….. and then the li<img src="images/Caracas/11.jpg" width="200" height="132" align="right" />ght came.  DHL was mentioned and like a flash of lightning, Miss M got in touch with  Vicky, the Marketing Manager in Ireland to enquire about help from them. Luck  was truly on our side because in less than 24 hours Miss M had confirmation  that DHL Ireland was willing to cover the costs to fly Mise, Miss M and I to  Costa Rica!<br />
    <br />
    <img src="images/Caracas/12.jpg" width="200" height="136" align="left" />The work was not over yet as we needed to get vaccinations, Aneamia tests  had to be done and International Health Certificates acquired…Against all the  odds, Miss M and Blancita managed also to get all the official papers, one day  before the departure date. A true miracle but more about this later!<br />
    <br />
    <img src="images/Caracas/13.jpg" width="200" height="134" align="right" />Our first flying experience was exhilarating but also a bit scary, for me  anyway. I can’t say for sure what Mise was feeling though. She had this air of  nonchalance and took the whole ordeal completely in her stride as if this was  merely another opportunity to accumulate some extra air miles! Miss M sat with  the pilots but was allowed to come and check on us after take-off where we were  standing between all the DHL packages in grey steel containers with only our  heads sticking out. <br />
    <br />
    <img src="images/Caracas/14.jpg" width="200" height="139" align="left" />We arrived safe and sound in our next (air)port of call…. so thank you so  much DHL for your very kind generosity, making it possible to continue with our  travels again.<br />
      <br />
      Mise will be spokesperson next time, telling all about our arrival in San Jose  and our experiences in our very first Central American country, Costa Rica.<br />
    “Chevre” as they say in Venezuela!!</p>
