  <p class="cnt">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left" class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/2August/01.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="130" />With                                   all the blabbering from Tu Fein in our previous                                   diary entry, I am sure you are all relieved that                                   it is me, Mise, who has the privilege of sharing                                   our TATA news with you again.</p>
  <p class="cnt">We                                   are conquering Central America slowly but surely                                   and I am happy to report that Miss M, Tu Fein                                   and I are currently in El Salvador. Our entry                                   into the smallest country in Central America turned                                   out to be smooth and painless and we were all                                   impressed with the speed and efficiency of the                                   people involved at the border.</p>
  <p class="cnt">It                 was going to be a two-day ride to the city of San Miguel so from                 the border we covered about 30km and had to look for a place to                 stay that night. After a few rejections, we found a farm on the                 outskirts of a small town and the owner agreed that we could graze                 in his green fields and Miss M could pitch her tent. After Miss                 M got ready, she had a rinse down and then ventured out to look                 for something decent to eat. She found a small eatery about a mile                 up the road and great was her surprise when she saw they had shrimp                 on the menu – and for a very reasonable price of U$D3 too!!                 The owner and his friends tried to bestow complimentary beers on                 Miss M but she stood her ground and declined these, burying her                 face in a book in which she was writing some personal diaries. It                 took them a while however to get the hint… Miss M also nearly                 got the opportunity to try out her machete that evening whilst sleeping                 in her tent but we will leave this story for another day!</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/2August/04.jpg" align="right" height="130" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />When                 we entered San Miguel, we went straight for the offices of a company                 called DIANA, who manufacture and distribute all kinds of snacks                 throughout Central America, South America and even parts of the                 States too. Miss M knew of this contact                 through her friend Marco Alvarez, who is also associated with DIANA                 in Costa Rica. The people at the offices in San Miguel had been                 waiting for us for days and they were all very happy when we arrived.                 Miss M got a very warm welcome from Zoila, Jose Maria (the manager)                 and Mario and they treated her to a lovely meal with freshly squeezed                 juices which she just loved!</p>
  <p class="cnt">From San Miguel we reckoned that it would have been                 about 4 days before we get to San Salvador City. Miss M decided                 that Tu Fein would go with nothing on his back as he had a few friction                 sores and she wanted these to heal first. The sun great for this!                 So, our bags were sent on with DIANA and Miss M only took the bare                 essentials with her. Everyday we realize with just how little one                 can get by……</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/2August/06.jpg" align="left" height="130" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />The                 road from San Miguel was quite hilly and it was up and down for                 quite a distance. The views were lovely though and, as we went slowly,                 we didn’t mind the mountain riding so much. We encountered                 a lot of road-workers and everywhere they were trying to improve                 the roads. One day, around noon we were approached by two men and                 they told us they were from a newspaper in San Salvador and would                 like to do an interview. We were delighted about the break and didn’t                 mind all the talking and questions at all! </p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/2August/07.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="25" width="130" />It                 was not so easy to find a place that evening but a lovely woman                 crossed our way (just before darkness fell) and she agreed that                 we could spend the night at her house. We had a lovely feeding area                 with juicy grass and Ms M had a comfortable mattress where she shared                 a room with Christa and her three children. Miss M was told about                 the hardships this family had endured and how they were forced to                 seek employment in the United States (and leave the children behind)                 as the situation and job-opportunities were so difficult in El Salvador                 (and still are). These stories (also about the war that ended in                 1992) were not told with self-pity but as a matter of fact. They                 were something that happened and was part of their lives and, despite                 what so many people in El Salvador had to endure, we noticed that                 there was always room for a smile and real friendliness.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/2August/07a.jpg" align="right" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="130" /><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/2August/08.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="130" />We                 were very lucky to have been invited by a couple called Eduardo                 and Leah Palomo for, when we arrived in San Salvador, Eduardo also                 arranged a place for us outside the city at a friend of his called                 Louis. Miss M was welcomed into the Palomo house with open arms                 and she had a real memorable and comfortable stay here. She and                 Leah went for water-aerobics a couple of times and Miss M claims                 that this had healed the kicked hip completely (she still walked                 with a limp on arrival in San Salvador but not anymore!). Leah also                 arranged a wine and snack get-together with some family and female                 friends at the <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/2August/08a.jpg" align="right" height="130" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />house                 one day and Miss M was really amazed at all the hospitality, generosity                 and enthusiasm for what we were doing. A couple of television Interviews                 followed and we had to be saddled up for these of course. Tu Fein                 put on his “Spaniel look” as he thought we were going                 but, as I am an old hand at this by now, I knew this getting ready                 was only for the Press and soon we would be in the comfort of our                 stables again! </p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/2August/09.jpg" align="left" height="130" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />Miss                 M was also invited for dinner to the house of Hugo Barrera, the                 general manager of DIANA and she was very glad that Eduardo and Leah                 came too as she was a bit apprehensive that her knowledge of Spanish                 might not see her through an entire night of conversation. One day,                 Mr Barrera picked Miss M up and took her to the factory of DIANA where they produce all the                 snacks. Well, any weight that Miss M had lost recently due to poor                 diet was made up for in about half an hour as she felt she just                 had to try every chip, every jellybean and every piece of toffee                 caramel! Miss M found Mr Barrera to be a very nice man and I am                 sure when the opportunity arises, she will tell more about him and                 also his experiences during the war. </p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/2August/12.jpg" align="left" height="130" width="200" />The                 invitations didn’t stop for Miss M and there was also a dinner                 with the Endurance Riders where Miss M was the Guest of Honour.                 She was even presented with a certificate, which basically stated                 that they were very impressed with our journey and what we have                 accomplished so far. Felipe, the President, also arranged to help                 Miss M <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/2August/15.jpg" align="right" height="133" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />with good trails from San Salvador City to the border with                 Guatemala and were really delighted about this as it means a quieter                 route, more dirt road and in general a more interesting way to go.</p>
  <p class="cnt">We                 have gained good weight whilst resting here in San Salvador for                 about ten days and both Tu Fein and I are looking forward to exploring                 yet more again. We will be in touch from Guatemala folks. Until                 then!</p>
