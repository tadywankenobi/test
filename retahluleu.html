  <p align="left"> <span class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/20September/01.jpg" align="left" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />It’s                                   been a while folks I know and the only apology                                   I can offer is to say that sometimes it’s                                   just not easy! I realise that a diary entry for                                   Guatemala is long overdue but better late than                                   never. </span></p>
  <p class="cnt">Miss                                   M has been on the road for about 15 months now                                   and although I only joined her and Mise in March                                   of this year in Brazil, it feels like I have been                                   part of TATA forever. Mise and I had a chat about                                   our travels the other night over a bay of hay                                   and a tasty concoction of horsey-vitamin food                                   and we couldn’t believe that we are now                                   almost through Central America. </p>
  <p class="cnt">Our                 first day in Gautemala from Yupitepeque to Jutiapa had brought its                 fair deal of nervousness, fear and anxiety which none of us would                 like to have repeated and luck, the gods, fate or whatever you want                 to call it, was certainly on our side. I am dying to give you just                 even a little hint as to what happened that day but I will seriously                 risk my position in the group if I attempt to share the gossip without                 Miss M’s permission. <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/20September/04.jpg" align="right" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" /></p>
  <p class="cnt">The mayor of the town of Puebla Nueva offered his                 assistance in the form of a guide that was going to take Miss M                 and us over the mountains to a place called Guanagazapa. He had                 no horse but because there was going to be so many ups and downs                 and rough terrain, it didn’t matter and Miss M ended up walking                 with us for most of the time too. Although the pace was slow, we                 were all covered in perspiration in jig time. After going for about                 4 hours, we arrived in a small <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/20September/05.jpg" align="left" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />village                 where our guide knew a family. We stopped for a rest and Miss M                 unsaddled us completely. We were given some hydrating gels and Miss                 M wouldn’t leave us alone until both Mise and I had sipped                 some water down to let the vitamins get through our body quicker.                 At this house was also a sweet little girl full of smiles and who                 loved Miss M’s riding chaps. The mother put a pretty dress                 on the girl and pictures were taken. As a memory, Miss M gave the                 little girl a photo of the three of us and also a little Irish Tin                 Whistle. Needless to say she was delighted!</p>
  <p class="cnt">We arrived in Guanagazapa in a way that was not planned                 at all and although I can’t say too much now, I can just add                 that in this world there are just some people you can not rely on….                 no matter how decent and friendly they look. But I will leave this                 story for another day (yes, I am sure everybody knows by now that                 means Miss M will tell what happened in her own time!).</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/20September/07.jpg" align="left" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />Miss                 M had a few things to do in a town called Esquintla and by chance                 we discovered a very nice place just off the side of the road, about                 25km from the town. The whole property was surrounded by high white                 walls and this was very important for Miss M as she is always looking                 out for the safest place for us, away from the public eye and curious                 stares… you never know what can happen when somebody lay their                 eyes on me (and Mise too off course!). The owners of this lovely                 Spanish Villa were not at home but the care-takers were so friendly                 and didn’t hesitate to offer their help when Miss M said that                 she needs a safe place for a day or two. We got a good rinse-down,                 did our customary role on the ground (Mise still can’t roll                 from one side to another – must be a female thing) and went                 off to explore everything around us that is edible for the night.                 Esperanza, the lady care-taker took Miss M to her room and a few                 minutes later we heard splashes in the pool… what an unusual                 luxury! The next day Miss M went into Esquintla by bus to send a                 few important mails and we were very happy to have an extra’s                 day rest.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/20September/08.jpg" align="right" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />From                 Esquintla the road was still a double-way but the traffic was heavy                 and far too many trucks and buses went passed us during the day.                 Mise nearly got us run over by huge trucks when she got afraid of                 some gaps in cement blocks next to the road (I’ll explain                 this later.. it’s a bit strange and complicated!) and Miss                 M got seriously annoyed at some hissing sounds of a young lad on                 the other side, leaning on his bicycle, waiting for a disaster to                 happen. Miss M was constantly worried about all the traffic but                 as we didn’t have anybody that could help us with alternative                 roads, we just had to push along. It was also very hot as we were                 not too far from the Pacific Coast and the air was hot and sticky. </p>
  <p> <span class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/20September/09.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="1" width="138" />We                 were very fortunate though that we had people waiting for us in                 Retahluleu...Tirso is the cousin of Eduardo Palomo (our host in                 San Salvador) and both he and his wife Annie were extremely hospitable                 and helpful. The Cattle Association agreed that Mise and I could                 stay on their premises and we both had our own stable. It took us                 a while to get used to al<img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/20September/09a.jpg" align="right" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />l                 the confinement of a closed environment for most of the day and                 on Miss M’s request we were taken outside every day for a                 couple of hours to graze freely. A Vet friend of the Cordova’s                 called Roberto came to have a look at us and recommended a rest                 of at least two weeks and off course we didn’t argue with                 him! We really recuperated during our stay in Reu and we want to                 say thank you to Alfredo and the people from the Cattle Association                 who as a sign of goodwill, did not even want any money for giving                 us good food and putting us up for almost three weeks.</span></p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/20September/10.jpg" align="left" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />Miss                 M ended up meeting most of the Cordova family and each one ended                 up helping Miss M in some way. Ana Lorena gave her assistance when                 Miss M had to go to Guatemala city and nothing was too much trouble                 for her. Tirso’s father, Don Tirso is a very well-read man                 and he was fascinated by our journey. He went through all the trouble                 of making her lots of copies from books about ancient treks through                 Guatemala and this surely made for interesting reading. Miss M was                 spoiled and treated so much during her stay in Retahluleu... there                 was an outing to the Amusement Park called Xetulul, which was a                 great day out although Miss M only braved it out on the water-boat                 ride whereas Annie couldn’t get enough of all the <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/20September/12.jpg" align="left" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />daring                 rides, spinning, twisting and twirling around until Miss M felt                 sick for her sake! Sunday lunch was with Don Tirso and Ana Lorena                 at a wonderful hotel at a place called Hostales de San Martin IRTRA,                 which is settled on lovely gardens with chalets and swimming pools.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Ricky                 Bressani (the brother-in-law) of Tirso offered his help to Miss                 M in the form of sorting out her route from Reu towards Mexico and                 they spent one whole day going in his pick-up, checking out the                 roads and see what the possibilities are. Miss M was looking for                 off-the-beaten-track roads but they soon saw that these trails would                 even be worse than the tarmac as it was literally covered with stones                 all the way. Miss M told us later how they nearly had an accident                 when a storm came up later that afternoon and they missed two huge                 trees falling on the road, by seconds. Shows you..... sometimes                 it is safer to go on horse-back!</p>

Before I sign                 off folks, I just want to say on behalf of the three of us, thank                 you very much <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_central2003/20September/17.jpg" align="right" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" />to                 everybody that we know and those we don’t know for continuing                 to send us lovely and inspiring messages on the TATA Guestbook.                 It is good to know that after all this time, we haven’t been                 forgotten (just yet). ADIOS!!!!</p>
