  <p class="cnt"><strong><img src="images/lapaz/bolivia_icon.gif" width="38" height="25" />Bolivia, Potosi : 16th October 2002</strong></p>
  <p class="cnt">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="cnt"> We                                   left the lovely city of Tarija on the 25th of                                   September with Alfalfa, Avena, <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October16th/16oct_01.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="120" hspace="15" vspace="10" align="right" />Maize, Afrecha                                   and Carrot-filled bellies, a new set of tailormade                                   shoes each (very expensive here probably because there are not to many horses around) and new energy                                   after a good rest.</p>
  <p class="cnt">Tusa                 had a sore tummy one day during our stay and Miss M got a huge fright                 when she arrived at Club Hipico to see poor old Tusa lying on the                 ground making funny noises. A vet was called out straight away and                 he confirmed that it was indeed a mild form of colic and with some                 carrots, wheat and exercise, Tusa should be well in no time again.                 Well, the friendly Vet certainly deserved all the fancy papers hanging                 on the wall in his rooms, because true to his word, Tusa was back                 to his usual self within a couple of days.</p>
  <p align="center" class="cnt">Our departure from Tarija didn't happen without its excitements                 and I guess Miss M would have preferred a more tranquil exitâ€¦                 but she has also learned by now never to get too relaxed because                 a surprise always lies waiting around the corner! </p>
  <p align="center" class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October16th/16oct_03.jpg" align="left" height="133" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="200" /> </p>
  <p align="center" class="cnt">The surprise in this case was the leading                 rope that has Tusa attached to the girth of the saddle on my back                 that got between my back-legs (without Miss M noticing). This was                 rather irritating and as I just couldn't stand still, I started                 kicking and bolting and at the same time charging and zigzagging                 across the roads - straight in front of the oncoming cars. <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October16th/16oct_03a.jpg" align="right" height="133" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="200" />All                 this off course resulted in the rope causing more and more friction                 on my inner-thigh and at this stage there was no stopping me. Miss                 M held on for dear life and at the same time trying to get me to                 stop and Tusa got dragged along, frantically trying to get out of                 the way of my kicks! Miss M thought at one stage that she is not                 going to stay on top and started to think of a way to jump of without                 hurting herself too much. And me? Well, I started to get tired of                 all the commotion and running after a while and finally came to                 halt under a tree.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October16th/16oct_04.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="250" />A                 few men (who had scattered away earlier) came forward wearily to                 give some assistance to Miss M who at this stage was suffering from                 the shakes!! Tusa only gave me a disgusted look but I got a sympathetic                 nudge later when I showed him the &quot;wound&quot; on my thigh                 where the rope took off the surface of my skin. It looked worse                 than what it really was but I enjoyed the attention from him for                 a while anyhow!</p>
  <p class="cnt"><br />
      <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October16th/16oct_05.jpg" align="left" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="15" width="300" /> It took us quite a while to get out of the bustling city and when                 we finally reached the road to Potosi - a dirt road - it was already                 close to lunchtime. There were very few cars around and with the                 odd truck or bus passing, we had the road for ourselves. Miss M                 decided to let Tusa run freely and he couldn't believe his luck                 when she untied the rope that is attached to the girth. When Miss                 M and I set off again, he stood still for a few moments and then                 realized that nothing is pulling him and started trotting in our                 direction (well, truthfully he first took a mouthful of grass on                 the side and then he came running towards us!).</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October16th/16oct_06.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="300" />Our                 first stop was a tiny little village called Tucumilla and fortunately                 it wasn't too difficult for Miss M to find a place for the night                 to stay even though there was some misunderstanding initially! No                 corral for us and as the evening came closer, Miss M brought us                 downhill from where we were munching on some dry grass-shrubs so                 that we were not too exposed in the cold and wind. </p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October16th/16oct_07.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="300" />The                 trip the following day from Tucumilla to Iscayachi must have been                 the most difficult so far. We went up and up to some really high                 altitudes and even Miss M complained of a headache. The air was                 thin and chilly and we could see she had little breath when she                 walked at times with us.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><br />
      <br />
    Leaving Iscayachi, our calculations regarding the distances were                 a bit wrong and we almost got stuck between the mountains with nowhere                 to stay....and this on Miss M's birthday and all! And this wasn't                 the only memorable experience of the day... <br />
    <img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October16th/16oct_08.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="200" />We                 were very lucky to have found a little village (called Puesto Grande                 with only about 5 houses) in between on the way from Iscayachi to                 El Puente because we went for miles and miles and no place in sight.                 A lovely girl called Reynalda offered Miss M a place to stay and                 we got some corn leaves for dinner. Not the most filling and at                 one stage Tusa suggested that we go and look for something tastier.                 We were not tied up and as Miss M was busy preparing something to                 eat herself, we quietly sneaked away. The next thing, a little girl                 came calling for Miss M, shouting that we are running away!! The                 little brat! Reynalda came chasing us with Miss M behind her (alreadly                 in her sleeping wear and slip-on shoes!). Tusa and I still laugh                 at what happened over the next few hours with Miss M &amp; Reynalda                 running after us as we were galloping back(it seemed to Argentina!)                 through the mountain road for about 7km. They tried to take short                 cuts to catch up with us but all they caught were cactus-thorns                 in their feet and fingers! I will let Miss M tell the story as to                 how we were caught eventually and it was already dark when Miss                 M and Renalda rode us back to the village, bare-back and without                 bridle &amp; reins. I am sure Miss M wouldn't forget her birthday                 easily, in fact she had two huge sores on her bum for a few days                 afterwards from the bare-back riding! </p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October16th/16oct_09.jpg" align="right" height="200" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="250" />Miss                 M thought it wise to go back to Tarija by truck to get some vitamins                 for us (she still is quite squeamish to give us the injections and                 I still won't still) because she sensed that we were quite tired.                 Leaving Puesto Grande, we had to travel two more days before we                 finally arrived in Camargo, the biggest town since leaving Tarija.                 From there on we went up higher and higher to altitudes of more                 than 3400 metres. We had a negative experience in a town called                 Cruz de Belen which now had been voted by us as the dirtiest and                 most depressing town in South America. For two hours we were assured                 that we will have a place to stay for the night and then finally                 nothing materialized. Miss M saddled us up again and left the town                 furious (and close to tears), not knowing where we will put out                 heads that evening. Fortunately all worked out well in the end but                 not without its frustrations and annoyances. </p>
  <p class="cnt">The last village before we reached Potosi was Kuchu                 Ingenio and although it was a very scenic and spectacular ride from                 there, it was also tremendously difficult and tiring. Potosi is                 the highest city of each size in the world at an altitude of 4070                 metres and when we finally arrived, we had to go through the city                 to get to a place outside where we were going to stay for a few                 days. We travelled that day for about 12 hours and we've never been                 so happy when we ultimately came to a stop and Miss M started to                 unsaddle.</p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/October16th/16oct_10.jpg" align="left" height="200" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="250" />Oh                 yes, we also saw our first Llamas on the way and Miss M got very                 excited, shouting and saying &quot;hola, hola&quot;. We couldn't                 be bothered too much about these strange looking animals and all                 they got from me was a formal nod. I am not sure if Tusa even spotted                 them as I think he was too occupied looking for something to stuff                 his face withâ€¦!</p>
  <p class="cnt">We are leaving for Oruro on Monday and it will be                 a good ten days before we will get to see the crystal waters of                 Lake Poopo and we hope to reach La Paz around the middle of November.                 We are counting the days because Miss M's friend, Tracy is coming                 to visit and both Tusa and I are really looking forward to meeting                 her. Tracy will also bring over bits and bobs that Miss M needs                 and included will be a few things from HorseHeaven (the best equestrian                 shop in Ireland - take my word for this!).</p>
