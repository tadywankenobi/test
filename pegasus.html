  <p><em>An update: 27 September 2009</em></p>
  <p>I have been involved with Pegasus since 2005 as one of three unpaid  Directors. As a not-for-profit organisation with charitable status, it grew  from only a few riders to more than 95 clients in 2008.</p>
  <p>After completing TATA in 2004, I was able to donate 30,000 euros in  installments to Pegasus over a four-year period and was also in a position to  help with numerous other aspects of the centre.</p>
  <p>There were many challenges though, including having to find new premises  for 2009 and also difficulties in having enough funds to operate on an annual  basis, including paying a salary to two qualified therapeutic riding  instructors.</p>
  <p>The lack of an indoor arena and the unpredictable weather in the  northwest did not help matters either, resulting in hundreds of cancellations  every year.</p>
  <p>The recession in Ireland  combined with the above problems forced us to make a decision in November 2008  to close down. This course of action was supported by Jill Carey, CEO of the  Festina Lente Foundation in Bray, Wicklow. </p>
  <p>Her advice was to develop a completely new business plan for Pegasus and  then come back to it in a year or two year’s time. To use her words: “There  will always be a need for these kinds of services”.<br />
    <br />
  Petra who worked as a therapeutic riding instructor at Pegasus decided to go back to  Slovakia and decided to walk with her horse Momo from Germany to her home  country. She started her adventure in June 2009 and finished three months  later. </p>
  <p>Her plan is to start a facility in Slovakia, offering riding to adults  and children with disability. Momo will be used as a therapeutic riding horse  at the centre.</p>
