  <p class="cnt">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="cnt">The stay in Tucuman                                   was wonderful (for us and for Miss M) and when                                   it was time to leave we felt very much rested                                   and ready to go again. We were accompanied out                                   of the city by the two Gaucho brothers and on                                   the way we saw some interesting things. First                                   we had to pass a lot of shanty towns and Tusa,                                   Miss M and I were shocked to see so many hungry                                   and skinny dogs around. Even the horses that they                                   use to collect rubbish and to transport fruit                                   and vegetables with are terribly underfed. Not                                   a pretty sight. We also saw a lot of smoke (burnt                                   car tyres) in the distance and Tusa told me that                                   this was a demonstration by some people who are                                   suffering and who all very angry about the economical                                   situation in the country. </p>
  <p class="cnt"> When it was time for                 the brothers to turn back, one of them gave Miss M his wooly french                 beret as a token of friendship. Unfortunately Miss M couldn't do                 the same as she needed her cap to keep the sun away from her eyes                 and face! The first 10km out of town was very slow and we got stopped                 a lot by people who recognized us. One man sang &quot;it's a long                 way to California…&quot; another wanted a signature, one man                 brought his small son to be photographed with us, another woman                 stopped us and said that she had done a 1000km a few years before                 on horseback…. But time was precious for us and we needed to                 continue. So when Miss M heard a voice in the distance and saw a                 small child running towards us, her first thought was not to stop                 but the child persevered, shouting and waving and we finally came                 to a halt. When the girl reached us, out of breath, she was so excited                 to see us and gave my nose a soft pat. She said her name was Gabrielle                 and she gave Miss M a little card that says, &quot;welcome to Argentina&quot;.                 Then she held out her hand and asked Miss M to write her name on                 it. She was such a sweet little thing and we will always remember                 her. </p>
  <p class="cnt"><img src="http://www.tatachallenge.com/newdiary/assets/photos_south2002/others/marianne10.jpg" align="right" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="200" />Tusa                 had an easy day on the way from Tucuman to Vipos as our saddlebags                 went with a man called Daniel Paz who was waiting for us on his                 farm with his wife Veronica. The farm consists of a few houses (his                 and his brother's), wonderfully located between mountains, a little                 stream that goes through the properties with corrals in the middle                 where the horses and cattle are kept. After Miss M's long and luxurious                 bath (she never thought she's be so lucky to get aromatherapy oil                 in her water!), they went over to Baston Paz's house for a lovely                 dinner. Daniel &amp; Baston have a band with two more of their brothers                 called Los Paz so there were singsongs until early in the morning.                 The brothers have wonderful voices and even I got twang of nostalgia                 when I heard the deep and soothing folklore sounds floating from                 the farmhouse. </p>
  <p class="cnt">The next day we headed for El Tala where Santiago                 Castellanos's brother live with his wife and six kids on a farm                 called Dateil. This is also the house where the Argentine Sculptress,                 Villa Mora was born. Miss M was very sorry to say goodbye to this                 lovely family two days later but she knew that we couldn't stop                 for long and that there are still miles and miles ahead of us. Tusa's                 sore back was much better after the rest and I guess the anti-inflammatory                 injection from the vet also helped a lot. </p>
  <p class="cnt">Miss M was worried about Tusa's back-shoes but was                 told that he would be fine until our next stop. Well, this wasn't                 the case because after 15km Miss M decided to have a look and found                 half of his one shoe missing. Fortunately there was a farm nearby                 and a Gaucho came out to help us. I don't know if I should say help                 because ultimately he did more harm than good. Tusa wouldn't stand                 still for him and the next moment he tied a rope around Tusa's back-legs.                 Before Miss M could get a word in to say &quot;take it off!&quot;,                 Tusa started kicking frantically, terrified of this snake-like thing                 around his legs. The shoe did finally come off but at our next destination,                 Rosario de la Frontera, Miss M got a Farrier out to re-do all our                 shoes and they noticed that Tusa's leg (just above the right back                 hoof) had been quite badly injured. There must have been an old                 wound and with the rope around the previous day, it went open again.                 The vet was called out and he said that the Tusa would have to rest                 a few days before we could continue. Miss M thought he might need                 more than just a few days to recover and decided to arrange a horsebox                 to get Tusa up to the Province of Jujuy. </p>
  <p class="cnt">Here                 the Leach family had a farm called Los Lapachos and they had been                 in touch with Miss M for quite a while, offering for us to stay                 there for a rest-period. It gave Miss M great peace of mind to know                 that Tusa was going to his farm but I didn't hear all the details                 so when Tusa got into the horsebox and I got left behind, I was                 frantic. He looked around and called out for me and when I heard                 his voice, I started running behind the pick-up truck. I was deaf                 for Miss M's and Bernard Elliot's calls and all I did was focus                 on Tusa in the horse-box in the distance. Sadly I didn't manage                 to catch up with them and not long after I was caught by some men                 on the side of the road who held on to me until Miss M came to pick                 me up again. All I could do, was hope and hope that Tusa and I would                 see each other again.</p>
